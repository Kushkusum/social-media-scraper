@CheukLamTiffanyWong,"In summary, why we always take things personally is because we care too much of our own feelings and we expect everyone to be considerate and responsible for our feelings. What we can do is really start not only focusing on ourselves, but embrace an open heart with empathy to others. You are not the centre of the world, so it’s key to keep it in mind and you wont feel like you are a victim.",2025-01-10T00:56:51Z

In some situations you can't afford not to take things personally. How else can you draw boundaries if you don't? I speak as someone who is only learning how to tell what's OK behaviour and what isn't... in my 40s. Not taking things personally meant I stayed in a DV relationship for years longer than I should have.

If you're not practicing the seven heavenly virtues, you are going to be much more susceptible to spiritual pain. Ask God what you can do to help the world -- not follow societal norms.

Another issue I’ve identified is that I give too much attention to everyone I talk to. I talk a lot, am easily convinced by others, and am always ready to help. As a result, I sometimes lose my value in their eyes. I’ve learned that it’s important to first respect and value yourself. By doing this, you won’t need others’ support to survive in the world. Love yourself first and don’t take things personally.",2024-10-09T16:34:50Z

@ZakarAlanyan,"Frederik Imbo's talk was really helpful and interesting. I really liked his approach to dealing with criticism. It made me think again how I react in uncomfortable situations. What I found most impactful was his emphasis on understanding that people's actions are often a reflection of their own issues, not a personal attack. I have been in this kind of situations a lot where my parents or friends suddenly started to speak not that good, but it was because of their own life problems. This change in mindset is really important for us. Imbo’s personal stories and humor made his points easy to relate to. In my opinion we should be able to protect our emotions.",2024-10-06T18:18:07Z

Even the deeds with obvious downsides are always done to improve something else in return. Every action is done by its doer because they think it will make things better. What ""making things better"" means might be different for everyone though.

It helps me to see beyond words that are hurtful. Instead of being offended, I try to find out want they want to improve. And even if I may not always agree with their goal and less so with their way of trying to achieve it, I find it helpful to understand people's motivations.",2024-09-06T18:58:13Z

Conflicts within family, friends and even corporate offices take a tremendous toll on us because we are connected to people emotionally and it is not possible to just write them off by applying these 2 strategies. You do have people who put up a whole agenda against you to push you down and at times it is okay to address your feelings internally instead of brushing them off.

-Shift my focus from me to we.

- 50,000 thoughts we use a day. 10,000 are positive & 80% of them are negative 😭 makes sense as to why God says to renew our minds daily Romans 12:2😭😔

-Practice seeing the positive of the other person’s intentions.

-Remind myself to not take things personally and that it’s not about me. However when it does not work then it was actually a personal attack. In which we need healing in those areas.

- When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are; that it was rooted in your childhood

- We can only take things personally if it somehow touches a raw nerve: Give myself empathy/speak up(tell the person what’s going on inside you).

- People May: criticize, attack, ignore, crumble your with their words, walk all over you, spit you out but remember: WHATEVER THEY DO OR SAY WILL ALWAYS KEEP YOUR VALUE.

Your value does not determine on what people do or say to you but only WHAT GOD YOUR CREATOR SAYS YOU ARE.",2024-08-06T04:10:28Z

@rubyariaw,"I was always a sensitive kid, I was made fun of because of my height, ofc it was just a kids thing I was in like 1st and 2nd grade. I didn’t really remember until a friend of mine told me how annoying and sometimes mean or selfish I was during that time. I was thinking about it a few weeks ago and I probably acted like that because I got bitter for being made fun of. Growing up some people at school didn’t really take me seriously, I constantly faced some kind of disrespect so all my sensitivity probably came from my childhood. More recently on year 9, after moving countries and school for the first time, adapting was hard, and on top of that I got made fun of, for some reason, by a group of people, I remember crying almost every day wondering what have I ever done to them. I was at my lowest point at that time. After a year with this group of people I started to know things about them that they occasionally mentioned in class.

So I began to realize that probably used me as a coping mechanism, somehow.

Because the girl’s dad died when she was young, probably from cancer. Her mom didn’t really care about her education. Her brother also went to bad paths and was the only one pushing her.

One guy’s parents are barely present in this life, when he was younger he always left school really late until someone got him, which I think most of times weren’t his parents.

And the other guy, I don’t know much of but he has a really special relationship with his mother and never really talks about his dad, so I bet he’s not really present either. And he’s brother was pretty “famous” in the area, meaning he also went to bad paths, he also had a reputation so I think somehow he felt pressured to have as much presence as him or to be like him.

They all had their struggles and still have a lot to grow. Knowing that I don’t really care about anything they say anymore.",2024-08-02T23:35:20Z

My mum says that I don't care and argues that I should try harder even tho I care for her every day since i was 14 im 26. My partner argues at me when I say you don't listen or understand where im coming from. What can you do when at every corner of your day week life. You get put down. Maybe move away whats stopping it from happening again, speaking up for yourself just for it to become an argument or judgment on your own being.",2024-07-14T23:19:52Z

this is so offensive actually it is not about ""take it personally""
people should at least explain or tell the truth ""I'm sorry I have to meet other friend tonight"" this won't hurt our feelings at least we should do this to get better communication

@KabirrVani,"Recognize It’s Not About You: Often, when people criticize or act negatively, it reflects their own issues, insecurities, or perspectives rather than something inherently wrong with you. Understanding this can help you separate your self-worth from others' actions or words​ .

Reframe the Situation: Try to see the situation from a different perspective. Instead of viewing a negative comment as a personal attack, consider it as feedback that might not be accurate or relevant. Reframing helps in reducing the emotional impact​ .",2024-06-18T09:01:33Z

@stevenjames3455,"A wonderful speech and certainly an important lesson in which I see great potential. Many of the people I see, hear, or interact with daily, especially in the U.K., show signs of low self-esteem and so indeed take things personally, which makes me sad. We should be taught from childhood to manage our emotions and see our value. 

Something I'd like to add to this speech, however, is that we should also actively recognise some of the mentioned behaviours from others as unacceptable. Honking the horn at another driver, shouting slurs, making personal remarks, etc. out of anger or other uncontrolled emotion suggests that the person themselves is struggling with taking things personally and managing emotion, thus directing it violently towards the person they deeply believe is causing their pain. That is anti-social, and no human being deserves to, or must, receive that from any other. We should be looking inwards, having compassion for ourselves and soothing our inner child before acting. 

It makes me so happy to see videos like this in circulation with 25,000+ comments and 580,000+ likes and, as another user suggested, we should be making space for these lessons in schools! I've seen the outcome first-hand when we do not and I believe it would make all the difference. 

Thank you Frederik for your words and I hope everyone reading knows their worth, has compassion for themselves and continues to, or starts to, do what they truly love. So long as we respect others and do not attempt to take away their light, we all deserve to take up space in this world. Have a wonderful day!",2024-03-12T13:31:37Z

Cómo no tomar las cosas personalmente.

Frederik Imbo (Un referee) plantea que, cuando tomamos algo personalmente muchas veces es a causa de nuestro EGO, esto divide en dos caminos nuestras futuras estrategias.
Podemos ser felices o estar en lo correcto, en el entendimiento y comprensión de lo que nos dice otra persona aveces tenemos que plantearnos la primer estrategia, “¿Está hablando acerca de mí?” Quizá no está hablando de mí, debemos ver la intención de la otra persona, “¿Está tratando de discutir un argumento o ganar una discusión?, dependiendo de eso debería constituir mi respuesta.
La segunda alternativa es que, en efecto estén hablando de mí, en ese caso debo iniciar el planteo de “¿Cómo me siento respecto a este hecho de mi personalidad?”, El pensamiento final que Frederik nos deja es “No dejes que tu valor decrezca por la inhabilidad de alguien para poder verlo”.",2024-03-09T20:02:49Z

@denisepooh6866,"Okay, Frederik was on point, sometimes having moments. In my mind, I ask myself, How can I not take so many things personally when I know that the other person isn't correct in any way? Even stopping and looking from the other person's point of view can be a great step. But what if you were in my shoes as a college student, learning about the right ways to apply office management and communication skills, how to word things by email as business management should, and using that book knowledge in my current position? I would take that knowledge and apply it to your everyday job and management. All for someone at a higher level in management doing it their way ""because"" they are the boss,"" and what says goes. How can I not take things personally when I know the boss is going against everything I am currently learning in college? It makes me feel like a degree is a waste of time. But I'm getting my degree. Unfortunately for the boss, I left without notice. Again, this boss doesn't do things by the book, so if you give her two weeks' notice, she will fire you the same day. I never did that before. But it took some time to look at the points. But that job wasn't worth the stress or the energy. Now I have a job where things make sense.",2024-01-06T07:58:17Z

@LuizMartins1989,"Why do we take things personally? 

Because our ego thinks that others should take ME into consideration and it wants to be right. 


Do you want to be right or happy? 

Chose to be happy; feel freedom, more energetic and in peace. No one will have power over you when you choose to be happy and not right. 

When you’re being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this is rooted in your childhood. 

We can only take things personally if it hurts a nerve, that is the moment you give yourself some empathy. Tell the other person what you feel without blaming the other person. This increases the chances that the other person understands you and takes your needs into account. 

Strategy:
Focus on the intention of the other person. 
Shift focus from me to WE. 


Conclusion:
It is not about me. Look at the other person’s intention. 
It is about me. Speak up without judging and blaming. 

No matter how much people hurt you; verbally or physically, YOU HAVE VALUE! YOU ARE A MIRACLE!",2023-12-21T16:32:33Z

@monicacasillas-bd8jc,Its best to avoid people that are toxic. For peace of mind simply ignore. Not over analyze anything in life. People have there own issues and they love talking about themselves its best to stay silent. And simply walk away you cant control what other people do. But you can control what you feel. Living in peace away from unrealistic expectations. That is why i love my celibacy contrary to society views. Im happier alone. Made the choice of respecting myself and love my worth. Solitude can be an opportunity for growth. Now im focused on starting my small business and healing. I had to be lonely first. That was most difficult and challenging but after i realized went through all the experiences of loss. I understood that people are cruel especially here in los Angeles and not everone has your best interest. I forgive myself dust myself off and understood it will all be okay. Im a strong resilient woman. We all are in a way. Through my painting my meditations sending out kindness 🙏 and prosperity to all.,2023-09-18T22:58:12Z

I'm simply already stressed to the max, and my classes haven't even started yet.

@doctorbalanar,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

01:05 🙅‍♂️ Learn how not to take things personally by shifting your perspective.
06:17 🪙 Two strategies for not taking things personally: ""It's not about me"" and ""It is about me.""
08:46 💭 Recognize that most negative thoughts are not about you and shift your focus to understanding others.
11:59 🪙 When the first strategy fails, reflect on why it may be about you and address your insecurities.
14:06 🤝 If criticism hurts, it may touch a childhood wound; offer yourself empathy and communicate your feelings without blame.

@smollilbean,"I'm an extremely sensitive person and people's words and opinions about me affect me so much, although now i have learned to pretend to not care about them and give them power unlike a few years ago. I have gotten pretty good in my acting of not caring, it was really bad just about 2 years ago though.

But i am sensitive to an extent that i would see old people or little kids in distress or crying and i would feel like crying with them. I would also get angry fast, specially with people that are close to me.

I'm also a girl in my last Teenage year, the influence of teenage hormones should have decreased to a great extent by now but maybe thats just how i am as a person. I don't know. But I just want to be in control of my emotions on the outside regardless of how im feeling on the inside, thats what i want.

@junbin3950,"There is a 3rd part to this equation, the one where our ego plays a role instinctively to protect ourselves. This is the natural part we want to change, but in some cases our ego is right. For example, someone is really attacking you out of spite & intentionally is trying to hurt you. They want you to show vulnerability not for them to feel empathetic, but to feel superior. It's really tricky figuring out which is which.

1. It's not about me. The other person is doing this because of him/her own issues

2. It is about me. And something that Im aware of and I too dont like about me. I need to change/they need to know im affected by it and its ok to be vulnerable with them

3. This person intends harm towards me. I must protect myself and not show any weakness. They are the problem and I do take their disrespect personally.",2023-07-17T03:33:26Z

@c-t-1164,"And sometimes there's truth in what people say but it is highly exaggerated, so it's a mix of the two methods. For example, let's imagine a person hasn't slept at all. This person is grumpy. If you talk a bit too much and the person  shouts "" just shut up we're all sick of hearing you talk"", there may be truth in it but it's highly exaggerated because his own emotions emphasize it.

Don't forget the context!

Oh and something else. Let's imagine you're an insecure introvert. If people keep telling you ""you don't talk enough"", you're gonna take it personally and think it's in your nature. You won't change. But if you don't talk enough that's because you're insecure! NOT because you're an introvert. A confident introvert is social and loves talking, just not the same way as an extrovert.

That's just an example to show you that most of the time, we don't understand ourselves or the other person enough. We need to be more empathetic towards the other and us. We should analyze the situation.

Just what I wanted to say :) love you all",2023-05-24T19:08:19Z

@kookiecat2803,"I tried “do you want to be right or happy” in my abusive relationship :( I kept thinking I’m too sensitive and emotional. It worked a bit though because I know someone else yelling at me and belittling and disrespecting me isn’t about ME. Yes, it’s happening to me, but it’s not my fault. I can recognize and realize he’s suffering with mental issues, but the yelling from a grown man is so damaging :( I want to care about his needs but he’s hurting me so much I can only take it personally. He says he’s sorry, he’s trying, I need to forgive or I can’t love. I never forgive anything he says. But I’ve been following “do you want to be right or happy?” I’ve been letting lots go. But I never forgive because he wants me to be nice and like nothing happened the day after he belittles me. Or that same day I should be over it because he said sorry. :(",2023-05-23T18:50:33Z

@gasparayakos8215,"Depends on what you mean about ""enhance our world"". While this was an awesome lecture, there's still the issue of discrimination. There are millions upon millions of people that are totally irrational and emotional. You deal with profesional soccer players, profesional coaches, and do Tex talks.
That's fine, but dealing with less educated, more confrontational people requires another level of understanding. This is why classes exist. Educated people *avoid* less educated ones because they speak different languages. I know this, I live in Chile, a country founded by pirates and the massacre of the indigenous population. There is no dialogue possible that would patch old wounds.",2023-05-21T15:46:39Z

Taking things personally , is absolutely my weakness. And I’m hard on myself to try and become the perfect person. 
To have empathy for me as well, would be the strategy that might help , when I feel criticized, disrespected and unloved.
Bút as a referee, you are in a better position to set boundaries or give a red card. 
I don’t have this authority in my job.
But I have lots of opportunities to practice 😬
It would be a great relief if I wouldn’t take things personally to heart and feel hurt so easily.

@LogicalMasti,"Q. How not to take things personally?
     Because now, here and now.
     I very conscious that this can happen.

Q.  Why do we take things personally?
-.    Our ego thinks that others should take us into
      consideration.
                      Our ego does not want to be criticized,
      Our ego acknowled that  'I am right' 
 
                    -  Two strategy - 
 1. It's not about me,  look at the other person's          
    intentions.
-  Because when I take things personally, 
    I am convinced it is about me. 
I simply need shift my focus for ""Me"" to ""We”. 

2. It's about Me, Give yourself  empathy , and speak up.
- We can take things personally 
    If it somehow touches  raw nerve.

        ""Peoples make attack you.
        criticize you or ignore you. ""

@ladyalpine4251,"I am about to be 65 years young (and readily confess that I am not to happy about it for various reasons, like qualifying for Medicare ouch, that just screams old), and grew up with a mother who did nothing but criticize.  The worst was being criticized for being “too sensitive”, that one always hurt.  It took a long time, but I eventually started replying with a simple thank you.  Because while I am sensitive, it comes with super beautiful and amazing benefits that I try to bless those around me with.  So yes, I am very sensitive but also an empath.  I can feel the pain others are in and have learned how to comfort them with my sensitive and empathetic nature.  Until recently I certainly have taken way to many things personally.  I’ve always known it was unhealthy, and hated how much it could hurt, so while I was chewing on it, I just couldn’t figure out how to make it stop.  But as we all know, LIFE has a way of teaching us over time what we must learn if we want to continuing growing.  And before hearing your talk, I began implementing your strategies.  First while on the road.  I would think to myself they must be speeding b/c they are rushing to the hospital to see their child’s birth  and rather than get angry or take it personally, I would begin to pray over them.  I would pray that they would reach their destination safely and unharmed.  And while I enjoyed your talk, truly, I did, it validated I was moving in the right direction.  Yet, I must say that I am far more impressed with how deeply you care for those watching your talk and take the time to respond to those who have taken their time to post a comment.  I have been deeply moved by how you’ve actually taken your own valuable time to reply and not only reply, but reply thoughtfully and personally, meaning you are not just sending a generic feel good message but responding to each person’s personal struggle and how you hope that your message and strategies will help them move forward in a more positive way.  It warms my heart in a way that hasn’t happen in a long while and felt encouraged reading how much you care for those who have reached out to you.  Thank you dear man for sharing, and spreading the love so many need, but so few have in this dark world we live in.  Please continue to shine your light and speak the truth into all those hurting by taking it personally.  And your comments about the fact that it may be personal, if so, it may be time to take stock of ourselves.  I appreciated how you spoke that message with true kindness.  I hope I have been able to accurately express how impressed I am with your kind and caring nature. My motivation was in hopes of giving you a lift today while you’ve been busy lifting others up. Thank you times infinity for using all the gifts the Big Guy above has blessed you with when He created you.  I know He looked at you and said well done, I am especially fond of this one! And all the angels sang and rejoiced over you. Thank you dear one. Thank you.",2023-02-16T21:28:04Z

For example, if people feel you're a better parent than them, some of them will gossip about YOU instead of focusing on themselves. Also, during a smear campaign, the audience invariably believes the offender and not the person being slandered. It's hard not to take that personally but the truth is, again, it has nothing to do with you since they are unsuspecting victims of the manipulator.",2023-02-15T14:53:40Z

@dianaverr,"I am a handball referee for 10 years now and when I clicked, for the title I saw, I had No idea he was also a referee. I can totally relate. It is sometimes so hard to be a referee. You know the rules, you have studied them So much and you practised all this years and still there are people in the stands who shout, who are violent, who swear a lot and it is God damn hard not to Take it personally. And in the last year, some people become Even more violent.
But I also stay to do this cause i wanna train this “not taking personally” attitude. What helps sometimes is what Oprah Said in an interview. People have different agendas. Supporters, players, team coaches they all want their team to win. So Any decision against them is a Bad decision. As a referee, my goal is to ensure a fair Game, to apply the rules corectly and to Take care of the health of the players. And this is it. Knowing that my intentions are the right ones helps me to not Take everything personal. 
Great piece of insight in the video. Loved the advice and some phases hit hard. I’d rather be happy. ❤",2022-12-28T09:41:21Z

 I know you cant forgive yourself because it was your ancestors that done this, white eurotrash.

But, it’s not necessarily a particular insecurity, for me, I have never found enough security in being confident in myself, generally. I don’t feel I know enough to be confident in myself. 

Whenever I try to rationalize what people are saying and even if what they are saying about me doesn’t at all line up with my experience, there will still be a part of my brain that questions me incessantly about it. It takes a while for the emotions and thinking to subside. And of course, that in turn just makes me question myself more. It is quite frustrating.",2022-12-23T00:41:39Z

Few days later a colleague told me she had worse with three kids falsificating her documents. It clicked something in me: woh, I should not take it personally, otherwise you can't get out alive!

@Selflove997,"Thank u so much Frederik lmbo & Tedxtalk for such an amazing session 😍🙏🏻

Here is my notes...


#  Why do we takes things personally ?
#  When somebody says something or does then why do we feel hurt, neglected, offended, betrayed by the other one...he/she is responsible for this for what I am feeling? 
• Whose says that which part of us speaking?  - our EGO .
• our ego wants consideration, wants to always right.
#  Do you want to be right ?
• When our ego takes over on us, we feel exhausted, drained because we are fighting or struggle with world all day.
#  Do you want to be right/ do you want to be happy ?
#  Strategies 
1. It's not about me...bcz my brain is already convinced that it's about me, my or mine....
So, convert this ME to WE....look at the other person's intentions.
• our brain produces 50,000 thoughts in a day & only 10,000 are positive. 
• to see positive intentions of other one required a lot of discipline & training. 

2. If 'it's not about me' doesn't work then use 'it's about me' & then you need to give yourself some EMPATHY.  And SPEAK UP & just tell the other one what's going on by opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one you increase the chance of other one will understand you.
• people may attack you, criticize you or ignore you, they can crumple with their words speak you or even vocal of you...but remember whatever they do or say they will always keep your value.
• Your value doesn't decrease because of someone's inability to see your worth.",2022-12-11T06:13:49Z

@Morpheus-pt3wq,"Stop caring, what others think about you. Instead, figure out, what YOU think about YOURSELF and work on it to think better of yourself. Because for people to value you, you must first learn to value yourself. If you value yourself and do not care, what others think, you won´t be so easy to offend or trigger. Even a personal attack may cause you to burst in laugh (which may actually offend the other side more than fists and rage). Work on your personal integrity, get a better understanding of yourself - of your needs, wants, pros and cons.

If people are not interested in you, go away. Those are not worth your time.",2022-12-01T20:33:14Z

@Red80008,"So... I don't want to criticise this talk because I know he's right and I totally understand all the other points but what exactly is the other person's intention to lie to you about hanging out with other friends, using a pathetic excuse, rather than just telling the truth as friends should do? And how is being lied to not personal? The only way I personally can think of how to not take it at least a bit personally, if I assumed that the other person has a problem and therefore can't be truthful os is afraid to be. ""It's not me, it's them."" Okay fine, but then you have to make a choice: do you want to play the blame-myself-game or do you want to play the blame-somebody-else-game. You're offended/hurt/unwell but either is neither helpful, nor compassionate, nor loving. So you're stuck with a very unfomfortable feeling.

Some things can (and imho should) be taken personally but then have to be addressed appropriately and as instantly as possible. Talking about unfomfortable things is way more important than we think. And so is the self. Being able to fight over something without endangering the foundation of a relationship is important but also dangerous and therefore and rightly so considered an art. Because we all matter the same and therefore we all should take care of each other. Both ways.

Not taking things personally and hoping to be therefore able to avoid conflicts is very dangerous and harmful. To oneself and eventually others.
Don't take EVERYTHING personally, though, either! Just know the difference between things that you can walk away from, because they don't matter and things that need to be addressed and ciscussed and maybe even fought over, because they do matter.
To you and maybe even to others! You'd be surprised...",2022-11-16T14:13:49Z

Although I suppose you can cling to your self worth as you're being ostracized because you're not a ""team"" player for simply having a different view or opinion.

Also many people spend thousands on an education to get a decent job so their worth simply ends up being a job that pays the bills and puts good on the table.  So maybe it is best to take this advice and pretend you're okay with the unhealthy environment around you to retain that job which pays for those things.

But what is the point of being a kind, empathetic and perspective taking person,  if whatever I do  does not and should not have any bearing or effect on anyone else's feelings or life experience? I feel like we take things personally because when we interact with others,  many times it is  about the other person.  Sometimes yes and sometimes no. And when someone has a problem with me, I ought to take it personally and take a look at it. It's not always about me, but sometimes it is. Unless we are talking about a small child having a tantrum.

@mintybusby434,"In my family, whenever I dare to ask a question like in his example, ""Why did you walk away and turn on the TV in the middle of what I was saying?"", the immediate response is, ""You're too sensitive.  Don't take it personally.""  So I should assume that you have coincidentally suddenly thought of a show that you wanted to watch that would be so much more interesting than what I was saying that it's worth offending me over.  Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  I guess I'm still stuck where I was stuck before.  😬  Don't worry, I haven't given up yet.",2022-08-19T15:51:47Z

@DreamSurferRelaxation,"Hey you. Yes, you. You're probably scrolling through the comments, like I am, reading all these motivational comments. If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. I hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well! ❤",2022-08-08T17:48:13Z
@rockerfaerie2,"He mentioned we have 50,000 thoughts a day, 10,00 are positive, and 80% are negative. I would disagree that the other 80% of our thoughts are negative, because this doesn’t leave room for neutral thoughts. “I need to go to the store,” “I wonder what my friend is up to,” “I should go to the gym.” These are just neutral thoughts, not necessarily positive or negative. Of course there can be additional thoughts to all of these that would turn it positive or negative, but many of our thoughts are neutral in nature.",2022-08-07T19:29:48Z

@Notester82,"Believe it or not, I watched this video last night (as of me posting this comment) and after going to sleep, I *dreamed* about a scenario where I ended up thinking about both of the strategies in this video! 

I was talking with someone and began to give a very long response to a question they asked and then at some point they interrupted me and said I was taking too long to get to the point. I initially felt bad, but then I suddenly remembered ""it's not about me, it's about we"" and thought to myself ""perhaps the person just doesn't want their time to be wasted or can't focus on what I'm trying to say with extraneous words sprinkled around. Then I thought about the other side (the ""it's about me"" one) and told myself that it's okay, but next time I should work on explaining things concisely. After that, I kinda seemed to change the topic before waking up and realizing ""oh my gosh, did I just practice Frederik's strategies in my dreams?""

Although I was happy with my career choice so far, during our last 6 months together she beat me down about my job because I was only making 38,000 a year. Not realizing at the time that it wasn’t ever about me but about her own career problems and insecurities I let her make me feel worthless.. After hearing this for months from the women that I loved, I then began to despise myself and question my own worth. My ego became inflated & I also started to hurt her in ways that I knew would devastate her.. Long story short I’m still in love with this women and I’d do anything to take back everything I had did to her despite the pain that she has caused me. With hate in your heart it’ll never be good… Choose love my friends before it is too late.",2022-07-06T01:54:43Z

@arielm1374,"As a manager working in retail, I've REALLY had to not take things personally especially if I want to keep my job. Some people will say and do the worst but it helps to see these people through the lenses of sympathy. If someone is screaming in my face being absolutely terrible, I just end up feeling sorry for them because they were never given the right tools to communicate or deal with their emotions. I stay calm and collected because then hopefully they realize how ridiculous they're acting and maybe it will embarass them enough to change their behavior in the future and even if they don't,  it's only a reflection of who they are as a person. It's hard for me to get offended for this reason. Talking poorly about others is just a reflection of who you are.",2022-06-18T03:50:26Z
@franciscoyanez2387,love it,2022-06-18T03:43:53Z
@basheeerz,"Just. Wow. Beautifully explained. 
The first point is definitely easier to apply (although I have trouble with that too).

The second point is where it truly gets difficult. Takes strength to introspect and make oneself aware of especially those things which trigger us. And then its even more difficult to work on those flaws and not let them irrationally control us.

This allows us to be more empathetic and kind to others as well as ourselves as we all are flawed human beings. Truly profound.",2022-06-17T23:23:12Z

It’s not about me, it’s we. 
Prepare your mind just like you would prepare your body. 
I have to look in the mirror and question myself. 
It has something to do with my insecurity or a part of myself I haven’t come to terms with. 
It only hurts bc I know it has some truth in it. 
When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are it is rooted in your childhood. 
Give yourself empathy. 
I’m longing so hard for recognition I feel sad if I don’t get it. 
Tell the other one what’s going on inside you. 
By being vulnerable and telling what u feel without blaming the other one you will increase the chance of the other one taking your needs for account.

@Zachorazor1,"It isn't as, ""simple as that."" Some of us fight the fights to stop people abusing us AND others. It's called societal correction; also called cultural conditioning, or even just plain teaching, those who should have already learned appropriate behaviour, that they should not continue to act in those ways.  

Blaming ego and choosing to not correct abusive behavior is cowardly and selfish.  Those who only care about themselves can use this strategy. Those who choose to help society need to not just deflect abuse, but to correct others.

Maybe the delightful person who gave this speech has never had the unfortunate experience of being in a relationship with a narcissist.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone!",2022-05-29T22:56:47Z

@AhmedNSane,"Me: I don't know why that person kept staring at me. 
Mom: Maybe they recognized you from somewhere. 
Me: Yeah, you're probably right. 

I never objectify people that it bothers me when people eye-eff me out of the blue, but now I think to myself, ""It's just a habit, and you can easily tell those same people are harmless, because as soon as you ask them for directions or something, they won't mind helping."" 

Sometimes it's really hard not to take things personally, especially when one of your best qualities is being questioned in a condescending way (in a professional setting), and no matter how confident, and level-headed you are, you feel like if you don't put that person in their place, they're going to eventually walk all over you — not that you'll let them. Sure, you can always try, and see it from the other person's perspective, but I still think that Paulo Coelho was right when he said, ""Sometimes when I'm angry, I have the right to be."" 

There's rarely any drama in my life, and that's how I know that I rarely take things personally. If anything, I get that ""what was that about?"" vibe whenever someone says something super salty out of the blue. Admittedly, sometimes it feels like you can't win no matter what you do; you try to calm the other person down, and you're suddenly being condescending, and patronizing. You tell it like it is without holding anything back, and you're suddenly reacting instead of thinking. 

Personally, I never care about being right, and when people do me wrong, I don't want/expect them to apologize, and when I do people a favor, they're not obligated to say thanks or be grateful. I just want to live peacefully, and I noticed that, the fewer the people I interact with, the less drama to worry about.",2022-05-28T05:01:11Z

Accept your Faults and the fact that no one is perfect.

@freetreatment786,"Solution to all problems:
I recommend to each & everyone and have personally experienced & cured from this 7 days therapy of surah 'Al-rahman'. I used to face multiple health issues like stress, anxiety, fear,negative thinking,insomnia & indigestion . 
But this therapy has today made me a new person all together, full of hope, enthusiasm, zest , positive thinking & to a top of it a better understanding human . 
HOW TO LISTEN:
Close your eyes and imagine yourself in presence of GOD and listen  surah ""Al-rahman"" in the voice of qari abdul basit with great concentration & focus . When the recitation ends , open eyes , take half a glass of water. Again close your eyes and say NAME OF GOD thrice in your heart & drink water in 3 sips. Take water this way every time after listening to the recitation.

I use to give people an OUT by pretending that they were just naive about the power contained in encouragement! But as the years have passed, I’ve realized that I was the NAIVE ONE. The reality is that on a conscious or subconscious level most people harbor ILL WILL towards others that may surpass them in some way!

@Frozone.,"In case you dont have much time, I made a script of the speach for you.



How not to take things personally? | Frederik Imbo | TEDxMechelen

Examples:
I take it personally when theres someone drivng behind me honking and flashing their light to make me go faster. 
While I talk about something thats important to me people go on the phone - I take it personally.
Someone does something and we feel hurt and we believe its there fault. 
It drains so much energy. If I didnt took so uch stuff personali I wouls be free.
The big question is, do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?

1. Its not about me 
People dont want to try to offend you and even if why should you care 
Try to understand of the Intention of the other one, why are they doing what they are doing.
Like child laying on the ground screaming ""I hate you"" ... is it about you? No! Its about what he wants and needs. Maybe some difficulties in the past that leads him to that behavior.
Look at the others persons intention - its not about me. 
Someone driving pushing you - maybe he is in a hurry. 

The big parts of our thoughts over the da are bad. We start to project our selves to be the reason why people are laughing ""my hair must be off"" then in reality they are talking about a funny clip. It takes practice and discipline to reroute your thinking.

People on the otherhand will shout on you, not because of you, but cuz they WANT TO BE RIGHT.
If I say to you, you are an Orange, would you believe me? No, cuz nothing in you believes you are an orange.

2. It is about me - Give yourself empathy and SPEAK UP
Just tell them whats going on inside you
""Hey im in the middle of story here, and you just went to switch of the TV. It feels that you dont care. Its nots that respectful.""
Open up, be vulnerable, telling how you feel with out hurting or blaming  the other one 
The chance will be higher that the other one will understand you 

If we would all practice this, it would make the world alot better. 
Remember what other people say about you, you will keep your value. You define yourself and are not defined by your surroundings.",2022-04-26T22:10:43Z

And even try to change the topic sometimes.... I'm a good listener.. Even though I'm not interested in listening to them.. I atleast make an eye contact with them... So that they think that I'm listening to them.. And not hurting their EGO... But I really feel bad when thye aren't giving the same response to me.... And thats what I wanna know is .

I wish I had these kinds of talks when I was still in school; a lot of the things I took personally back then really made me feel miserable and stuck with me for a long time. The closing part hit me in the feels… Been going through a rough part of my life and taking what mean spirited people say about me and my situation has made me even more sad, but I’m glad I watched this.

In other words, you have a new thought every 1.15 seconds. He says 80% of our thoughts are negative.

Criticizing me, insulting me, disagreeing with me, often times without even responding to my initial comment! All they do is make assumptions about ME without even going further into what I initially said. It drives me mad.

@arthurmoraud9234,"Really good speaker. He shares his emotions and thoughts so easily without filtering what could be used against him.
By putting himself in a vulnerable position, people easily give him their attention. Even though at the beginning, he's perceived as pitiful by being so vulnerable, by showing that he's aware of it and still does it reveal some serious confidence. It's part of his charisma and it radiates warmth.

About his message, I'm conflicted on it. In term of relationships, I do think it's a very good strategy. But on a personal level, he's still fuelling the EGO by placing so much attention on the viewpoint of others. This weakens his awareness of himself.
""I'm not who I think I am, I not who you think I am, I am who I think you think I am.""
By placing so much attention on other people viewpoints of him, he reinforces the number of thoughts about his own value. And it's much easier for negative thoughts to prosper in this environment compared to positive ones.

I would rather pursue a path of detachment to other people opinions of myself. Understanding that people's opinions of me is based on their own criteria of what is good and bad. That's why it's better to focus on the people who share the same values as you and let go of those who think less of you because you are different.",2022-04-02T13:22:33Z

@dragon67849,"This one seems only half correct. The conclusion is absolutely correct but certain roads you take to get there are way off. I mean this all from my perspective of course. We reached the same conclusion but took different roads to get there. For you it seems ego is the biggest perpetrator but for me it's insecurity. Thinking I'm not good enough.Weed didn't exactly help that but I have since quit and my life has been so happy. I still take issue with certain people not responding but instead of lashing out I just ignore it. I have better things to do than worry about what people think of me. One video that helped me get through this is a video by Kurzgesagt or in a nutshell on youtube. It's about loneliness and it describes what you mean perfectly.
Still, you provide an out whereas Kurzgesagt does not. But watching both might still be beneficial. Kurzgesagt, sponsor me will you? I'll plug you all day every day you're soo good (as if they're gonna see this XD).

We never consider other people's state of mind or do a reality check before forming opinions. Relations would be very successful if everybody follow these pieces of advice.,2022-03-15T04:51:47Z

@saadams4937,"I agree! A very nice talk and it seems to have touched a lot of people. I rarely take things personally anymore because A. I generally have no clue what the other person is going through to be reacting the way he is doing and I have to give him the benefit of a doubt, in case he is in a difficult place in his life/psyche and that is making him act out (which is more than likely the answer to begin with); B. If I am unable to turn off the hurt or offended feeling with A., I know that there is something in my own psychological background that is (also) being triggered. Then, I usually just address my issue with a technique called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) and everything evens out, usually quite quickly. A good thing to notice also, is that many people DON't get triggered the way I do over the same things that I may be reacting to. So, my reaction HAS to be based within me, since my feelings of insecurity, anger, rejection. confusion, fear, resentment, etc. are not necessarily universal. EVERYONE is afraid of fire and reacts to sudden loud sounds. Those are universal fears, built in for survival. They are valid fears and should be respected and heeded. Most anything else, especially in everyday human interactions are not necessarily valid and are best scrutinized. I would say ""objectively"", but I don't really believe in objectivity. After all, whatever stance we take towards any subject is still taken from our own perspective. We may change our viewpoint and shift to a different focus on a problem, but even that shift of focus is coming from our own perspective and that perspective, although now altered, is still subjective. We work from within. In essence, EVERYTHING in our reactions is about us. It's our job/responsibility to order our world in such a way that it is comfortable and productive for US. And the more we learn about strategies like the ones in this video to do this effectively, the happier we will allow ourselves to be. Thank you, Frederik for a very well done and useful presentation!  🌿",2022-03-14T22:17:17Z

@newstart9123,"Hi Mr. Fred I just wanted to share somethings I've learned.  The way a person treats you shows you who they are, and the way you respond shows you who they are.   So, someone says you should leave your career of 15 yrs. because you are just not cut out for it.  That person may just be sick and tired of their job and want nothing else to do with it.  It's called self projection.  You spot it, you got it.  You name it, you claim it.  Lets say you go to a meeting out of town and you see someone there and think ""They don't like me because their not talking to me.""  In reality you are the one who doesn't like them, because no one told you that and you didn't hear it from them.  We are a reflection of each other.  If you examine yourself you will realize there is something about that person you don't like which is why you are the one not talking to them.  The ""I"" statement of therapy is one of my favorites.  Ex. I feel ""sad"" when you ""walk away as I'm talking"" because ""it makes me feel unimportant."" Or, I feel ""insecure"" when you ""come home late"" because ""It makes me feel that spending time together doesn't matter anymore.""  It's also about seeing your own self worth even if no one else does.  When you worked hard on that project that you were proud of and no one else acknowledged it, it's okay because you did your best, gave it your all and felt great about the outcome.  We can't control anyone else's feelings or emotions.  When you begin to build your self esteem you will be able to see when someone is honking and flashing their lights behind you, it's about them not you.  I usually think what's their problem, or, oh well that's between them and God.  When someone has a problem they have to deal with it not you.  So, unless your in the fast lane on the express way driving slow, then I would suggest moving over to a slower lane.  Sure our hearts will always race or jump when we are honked at, but again if they have a problem they can always go around or just continue feeling some type of way following behind you.  It's up to them.  You are not here to move, think or feel the way anyone else wants you to.  If your driving slow and just cruising on a Sunday afternoon, you have that right to enjoy yourself and there's nothing wrong with it.  If you grew up around people who were only concerned for their own profit or pleasure (you getting a 10 making them feel good) at others expense, then you may need to unlearn some negative learned behaviors. Make a conscious effort to listen to the words that come out of your mouth and if they sound familiar (like your parents) then put yourself in that other person's shoes and remember how it made you fee.  You didn't go through all that for nothing.  You are in your destiny and you are meant to impact the world to change for a better place.  Even if it is only within themselves.  Thank you and I hope you get a chance to read this long message.  Peace, love and strength I send to you.......",2022-03-08T17:57:40Z

@khakicampbell6640,"I agree with the premise of this talk, well done. But I'm wondering, where is the line between not taking things personally(seeing from the other's point of view), VS letting people walk all over you? The ego shouldn't dictate our actions, but ""no ego"" or extreme empathy is often an invitation to be abused in this world. Some messed up people won't stop negative behaviors willingly, even when given a reasonable boundary. Also, even if we don't ""take it personally"", we still have to deal with what they are spewing out, in our direction. 
Seeing things from another's point of view is very important indeed, but honoring ourselves by understanding and maintaining our personal social boundaries seems like a healthy behavior as well.

It's one thing to choose plans with others it's another to also lie about it. If their reason for lying about it is valid* then you really should take that personally. If they didn't have a good reason to lie then they should have communicated with you.

It's just the right mix of enthusiasm and psychology into the minds of people and their social interactions. I definitely do my best to use the advice in this presentation, and it has helped immensely - I don't feel so wound up or stressed out anymore. 
I also shared this presentation with my college professor and classmates for an assignment because sometimes I feel that as a young Millennial (and my fellow younger generations), we need this kind of guidance to practice harmonious person-to-person interaction instead of having lessons and drama beaten over our heads.

Ephesians 1: 13-14 says that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day that God redeems us. Ephesians 2: 8-9 is clear in that we are saved by grace through faith and not by our works or by what we do or do not do.

@charlieburton9610,"A couple of points about this: 
1. It's easy to disassociate that way if it's with a third party. (Like the refereeing. Or my customer facing job). You can understand where they're coming from and accommodate. ""It's not me"". But should you *have* to do that with family? Isn't being ""personally"" affected by someone's actions what makes them 'family' in the loosest sense?
2. There is a distinction between understand and accepting. You *understand* why your spouse got up to turn on the TV when you're mid-rant about how you're feeling low. But would you want to *accept* and be okay with the fact that your spouse isn't being supportive? (If it happens repeatedly)",2022-01-25T18:30:47Z

@isabelli7931,"algumas anotações pros br:

*Não leve as coisas pro lado pessoal*
As coisas que as pessoas fazem dizem mais sobre elas do que você.
 
*Não é sobre mim.*
As pessoas tem suas próprias vidas. Olhe pela perspectiva da outra pessoa. Se eu tentar ver a intenção do outro, abro espaço para compreensão ao invés de irritação.

*É sobre mim.*
Reflita se o que a outra pessoa falou é verdade ou não, veja se é alguma insegurança sua. Assim, tudo se torna um aprendizado. Após essa reflexão, seja gentil consigo mesmo. Tente se entender. 

*Seja honesto*
Diga a outra pessoa como você se sente com relação as atitudes dela, o que você não gosta e porquê.

E por final, lembre-se: ""People may attack you, criticize you or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out or even walk all over you. But remember: whatever they do or say, you wil always keep your value."" — Frederik Imbo 

🇧🇷: ""As pessoas podem te atacar, te criticar ou te ignorar. Elas podem te amassar com palavras, cuspir ou até andar por cima de você. Mas lembre-se: não importa o que eles façam ou digam, você sempre manterá o seu valor."" — Frederik Imbo

In fact I realised that I hadn't let go of that conflict until right now.
Thank you Frederik. This advice worked for me. It wasn't the first strategy, which nearly everyone tells you to try. It was the second strategy.

I want to set everyone to that standard, and I will, even myself. Now the only thing is conveying to others to respect that boundary in a way that will allow them to understand, sounds like a mutual agreement is in order. Any other ideas for people who feel they want to break boundaries?

I just found that keeping your boundary is the difference between insanity and sanity. keep your boundary above all else, find what your boundaries are and tell people they are not allowed to cross it",2021-12-24T15:42:44Z

@zakariyamaxamed4183,First thing people must know is that there is a true statement says everything happens for a reason and for that reason we should not take things personally.. If you have to fight for it it does not meant for you because what is for you will be for you regardless. Second thing I would say is all people are not emotional or looks people the way you do so you cant internationalize the way you feel because Humans are not all the same feelings because sometimes a bad thing can be a good thing for you or good thing can be bad but either way we should not be always on alert on what people do or say.. because only that will make  unwanted silly never ending conflicts and always saying WHYYYYY....,2021-12-18T23:00:40Z

@dimitrispantelakakis6029,"Ok, this is ridiculous. Too many times people are offensive and cruel and so little to no compassion. And you have the right to get angry about it either if you take it personally or not. Especially when we talk about personal relationships, you have the right to expect your partner and/ or friend to be reliable and honest, to care about you, and to show some affection when you conspicuously need it. ""Ego"" is not a bad thing, even though it could be if you overfeed it... And I know some people do, and advice like this may be helpful for them, but the majority don't and the people who forbear toxic behavior and indifference from those they hoped to stand by, are far too many. Stop over-generalizing your life lessons, as if they could apply to anybody or to any situation. If the work that you've strived for took only criticism from your co-workers and you want to talk about it you are right to expect your partner to listen and advise you. And if your friend lies to you about their plans and avoids you then you are pretty much entitled to take it personally and to ask them the reason.",2021-12-17T11:23:30Z

Many people have lies in their head that they can't trust anyone. And maybe that trust has been violated in the past. Work on rebuilding that trust.,2021-12-17T01:47:45Z

Some people have said stuff about me and it didn't faze me. I think if we value a person more than we take it personally",2021-12-16T06:53:13Z

@smaruhmaruh6955,"First lesson: 
You take things personally because of your ego, it's because you want to be right. 

Second lesson:
Try to see the situation from the perspective of the other person.

Third lesson:
When you get criticized or shouted at, it is because the others just want to be right.

Fourth lesson:
Give yourself empathy and speak up.

Fifth lesson:
Whatever the others do our say, you will always keep your value.",2021-12-04T10:48:25Z

@Ibraheem_akm,"Not always so simple especially if you're the ""understanding"" type your whole life.

If you're the type that gives others empathy, and all the good treatment while acting like some hero😆, that won't last long if you aren't balanced.

You eventually switch to not trying to understand others first and turn to listening to your emotions that have been bottled up etc for so long first.

Me, me, me, I, I, I...   that will naturally come like an avalanche.

Too much ignoring of the ""me"", ""I"", ""myself""...

You'll end up taking things personally.. because of how other treat you when you dont stand up for yourself.

So it is about balance.",2021-11-12T03:23:26Z

@blodknut5595,"Great talk. It was interesting to see how I had already adopted ways of dealing with situations like encountering office mates abruptly ending their conversation as soon as you enter the office space or feeling highly anxious in a public place like a cafe when I am just with myself. With the former situation it’s the rationalisation of all the alternative scenarios - they were having a private chat about a personal confidential matter and that’s why they stopped talking when I entered the room - perhaps on workmate was complaining about our boss and they wanted to be professional and not spread their discontent among the work team. With the later at some point I realised firstly no matter how internally wound up I feel people only see what’s on the outside and secondly that most people are thinking there own thoughts or thinking about themselves rather than the room only focusing on me and my anxiousness. Fredrick’s framework of the two coins really brought my ideas neatly together for me - It’s not about me. I had to laugh when Fredrick insulted the audience by calling them “orange”. He was correct- we ginger haired types can feel that word to be an insult. As he rightly discusses, that feeling of insult goes back to our childhood of enduring schoolyard taunts about our hair colour, feeling different and just wanting to fit in to the group.",2021-10-31T13:47:50Z

@1983trendsetter,"Opening up to others don't make others to understand, in-fact many times opening to others exposes vulnerability and others take advantage of that. Even trusted one also can change as its human nature. Its all your personal values. Many like chattering about your issues to others and at the end it makes you feel guilty. Its always important to find right person who can understand. It breaks the soul if that known person only breaks your trust. Always try to identify your personality. If u r highly sensitive, keep yourself away from negativity as it wont cost anything to others but you will loose urself. Do what you like and just ignore the rest.",2021-10-30T07:49:03Z

@waschell1,"you put in a Ted Talk exactly what I've always tried to convey to clients as a counselor but have never seen it in such a unique way.

@amandaburgess7496,"Whilst I agree with the concept of what Mr. Federik Imbo discusses, I disagree with the reframing of discussion to be positive.  In his example of colleagues talking then laughing when seeing you, realistically, they may be talking about you, therefore the disagreement in the positive reframing of mind.  However, in saying this, I agree with the concept of not taking this personally.  The colleagues laughing at you says everything about them and who they are and nothing about you or who you are.  It stems from their personal insecurities.  
An expansion on his concept is, through overcoming your own insecurities, you are able to overcome taking things personally.  This is because your insecurities are directly linked to what you would and would not take personally - i.e., his reference to ""...you are an orange"".",2021-10-24T02:23:23Z

@thejudithjack,"Wow, this ted talk was needed. Going through breakups in the past, i came to believe that i wasn't good enough. I took it personally if the other person didn't want me, now listening to this i held a self therapy session with myself and found that  i secretly didn't think i was good enough. Parts of me said i deserved being neglected because i'm not good enough to be kept or wanted. When i called myself a queen i secretly didn't believe it. It didn't resonate with my soul, i was just mouthing words. But a lot of self realization has come from this very simple message. Perhaps people leave because you are not what they want, they have a different taste, and that's totally normal and ok, but it doesn't make you undeserving or less than. We should all be allowed choices and you are not everyone's choice. Not everyone likes/buys Gucci, but it doesn't change the price of their products. Heck they won't even give a discount, if you don't like it keep it pushing. It used to be about you but once you dealt with your trauma and insecurities, it stopped being  about you.

You are right about your decision to become a referee because simply you want to learn how not to take things personally. And it actually works for you. But not for them though. They never knew about your reasons. They were just there watching you being a referee expecting that you knew the rules but then disappointed. This is just an example of simple misunderstanding between you and the criticizing crowd. So technically, you’re right not to take things personally. :)",2021-10-16T01:01:02Z

@eyespyredbricks9363,"You are much appreciated for sharing one of life’s vital lessons. The knowledge gained from your words will have its greatest value when one is able to use wisdom to regularly apply it in their lives. 

There’s a saying which helps me to remain centered in not taking things personally a majority of the time: Misery loves company.

People who are emotionally and mentally weak easily become jealous/envious of people who are stronger than they are in those areas as well as many other areas.

When people feel a need to say or do things ‘to’ you, whether they are conscious or not of what their actions will cause, their ego’s goal is to bring you down to the level of pain and suffering it’s experiencing at that point in time. It cannot handle being around people who have it together and are happy most of the time.

This is when I shift my focus onto the saying ‘misery loves company’. NEVER take it personally. Instead, see the sufferer as the one who is taking something about you so personally that they would go to great lengths to bring you down in order to prop themselves up.

When we can master this, then an even more challenging lesson to master is catching one’s own ego in the act of being the sufferer seeking out company to share in it’s own misery. It must be put in its place. Once we master this lesson, we will no longer play the victim of the ego and, instead, become the victor of our true self. Then, nothing can phase us.

We are what we think; therefore, think wisely.",2021-09-19T15:53:05Z

And all that stuff even today i still think that like when my parents get angry at me, when i don't even know what happened in there day they could have had a terrible day at work or something. So never blame yourself for a best friend moving away because they might not have a choice it might be there parents choice and never blame yourself when your parents are angry because u never know how there day was they could of had a rough day and that even goes with friends if there mad at u don't blame yourself they could have had a bad day today too. :)

I would say taking something personally / being offended is at times (where the facts and circumstances are clear) very legitimate and probably even healthy? If someone stomps on me and I don't get offended, it would be likely to happen again no? Taking offence seems to be one form of self-preservation...At some point, after enough wear, even those 20 Euro will be discarded by the bank and replaced. Thoughts?",2021-08-05T13:45:36Z

@Sarahizahhsum,"Okay so this is how I understand this concept. 

1. For biological threats (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) the immune system fights them off. 
2. For physical threats (violence, being attacked by a predator, too hot or cold) the fight/flight/freeze/fawn response fights them off. 
3. For word threats, emotional threats, I do know that fight/flight fights them off, but it doesn't work. What system handles that? I know mine is broken (as is my immune to an extent and my fight/flight), so I must learn how to strengthen it or calm it down. I have methods to calm down the other two or strengthen them to be more realistic, but I don't even know the name of this third hidden defense mechanism. It's obviously there but what's it called? How do I regulate it?",2021-08-01T14:05:17Z

@tranglomango,"What a load of bull
A referree to learn to not taking stuff personally?
Just go work at Macdonalds",2021-07-20T11:54:37Z
@petermeyer6873,"- Someone, who doesnt take things personally: Someone, who doesnt care at all, maybe a psychopath.
- Someone, who takes all things personally: An egocentric believer in social rights and social/emotional intelligence.
- Healthy/firm person (or generally born before 2000): Probably doesnt need to be told, what to take personally and what not.

Frederik Imbo gets other words and things wrong also:
- Taking things personally is not the same as considering things important! The guy 2:10 in the car behind yours is addressing specifically you, so its correct to take his angry message personally. But that doesnt mean one should consider this message or him to be of importance.
Same goes for most of the other examples he tells. Most of them are examples of things, which ought to be taken personally simply because they are and wouldnt make any sense otherwise.
- Beeing right is not the same as insisting on beeing right! ""Do you want to be right?"" Well, dont you? And dont you want others to strive for that, too? Really? Isnt beeing right important and good? What about that referee-example and why should there be a referee, if he didnt care about the game to be played correctly? What if a pilot or a chirurg doesnt care about beeing right anymore? Who wants to be on that plane or under that scalpel? Does anyone really want to live in a society with a large proportion of people not acknowledging what is right?
- Also, he gives no explanation for his strange conclusion, that one can experience more harmony in the presence of people who dont give a f*ck about anything.
- Insisting on beeing right or in other words avoiding to even think of beeing wrong is a matter of the ego as is going on stage and acting or giving a presentation like this.
Its totally ok to feed the ego for beeing right as long as one cares to be right in the first place.",2021-07-20T06:41:30Z

@TobbeRex,"Man, that first example was a horrible one considering the points he's trying to make. If you are inviting someone to go to the movies and they decline, claiming they have to work and then go to dinner with other friends, that is something you should definitely take personally. There's no ""oh maybe it's because of this thing or that"". They have lied to you instead of just telling the truth and saying they had other plans. If you don't take that personally something is very wrong with you because that is pretty much the definition of someone doing something against you personally. The same goes for the ""looking at you and then laughing"" example.",2021-07-19T22:45:50Z

I'm the same. I'm an academic researcher and imposter syndrome is awful (and very real!). Also as a rugby coach, I never played rugby..who am I to teach others how to play!?

@Mike-sp2eu,"@2:00 I had a buddy move to Colorado springs about 7 years ago and first week there he said someone was shot and killed for cutting another person off,.. in this case the person really was hunted in the end,. Even if you don't take something personally, doesn't mean the person next to you won't take it very personal,. Look at the riots over the incidences that caused them,. Thousand took it personally and didn't even live in the same country. I don't feel we have free speech anymore because people take things more personal than intended or just too personally for no reason. A guy could break into your house and kill a family member and run and the cops could shoot him,. In most normal cases people would be serves the criminal right or what did he expect was gonna happen after you kill someone. And then there's cases where people think just because he killed someone that the cops shouldn't have killed the criminal. Taking it Personally is in the perspective of the person and most people like to blow things way out of proportion,  like the covid pandemic,. The Spanish flu now that was a pandemic. Covid was just a bad flu season,. Trust me heart disease and cancer killed way more and that's not a pandemic yet",2021-07-16T00:55:26Z

Thankfully the time came when I could get off the bus and get away from him but the conversation had inwardly shaken me up. When I reached home a dear family friend had come to visit but my greeting was not very warm (my mind was still dealing with all the horrible suggestions that bus driver was making). I registered an instant look of hurt on my dear friend’s face and deeply regretted coming across so cold and distant. (I don’t know how I managed to salvage my evening with her) but I hope to recall this experience as a valuable lesson…people can behave in a negative manner towards me but there could be a real reason or excuse for why they are.

@HoneybatzRa,"Absolutely excellent talk.  

As someone who has always taken things personnaly, Frederik's talk has inspired me to look at WHY I do this. and to try and train myself not to take things to heart.  (I will NOT be taking up refereeing in order to do this though ^_^ ).

In my opinion, it seems very simplistic but it is probably the most difficult thing any individual can do is to be more empathetic with themselves, which in turn reflects positively onto others around them.

I also believe that this is something which needs to be taught in all schools from a very early age. Our young people are living in a world which seems to be more and more centred on a 'ME ME ME' culture of entitlement with themselves at the centre of it.  Talks like this  would enable them be able to see life in a more community driven, inclusive and positive way.

…However, this pointed to an old wound of not feeling confident in my physical looks and a remembrance through childhood that our family couldnt afford the lifestyle that some of my friends had…feeling that divide at a young age but thought i had dealt with all of those beliefs of ‘not being enough’….so…more work for me to do and plenty of self loving and empathy…instead of the self loathing that reared its head unexpectedly… Thank you ✨🙏✨",2021-07-04T10:23:10Z

@BlackRockExecutive,"Hi Frederik, I really enjoyed your talk, particularly the fact that you have a sincere intention of making the world a better place. 

I believe that one of the reasons that we humans take things personally is that it is part of our defense mechanism to fix something that can be potentially wrong with us, because ultimately we fear of dying (example: something wrong with us = bad performance at work = no money = no food = death), and we would want to do anything to survive. It is the fear of letting go of the chance to identify something can be wrong with us, that makes it so difficult to not take things personally.

@rebekahcodlinart,"hmmm i would disagree to a point. If someone starts txting in front of you while you are talking to them, it is logical to believe you are at least partially to blame, because you are in fact less important to them than the person on the other end of the phone, this is an objective truth. If what you were saying was more interesting to them than replying to their other friend, they wouldn't actually be txting. Someone who takes things personally is someone who is dependent on other peoples reactions to them for their self esteem and feeling of security. Each time they are ignored, and they take this personally, it is because the ignoring is an objective sign of their diminished importance to that person and this signals that they have little power in that persons life to change their behavior, that person has signaled that they feel no pressure to pay attention, and are also not interested either. thus making the offended person feel weak. The way you stop taking other peoples opinions personally is by placing little importance on their opinion of you, find other ways to build yourself up with confidence and self assurance, this way you will instead annoy others when they try to control you, instead of being offended when you cant control them.",2021-06-29T03:14:31Z

@bytez.rm_,"Points of your presentation are right on.  But certain moments in life require us NOT to be insipid bullet proof aloof persons out to artificially support our personal positive outlook goals.  If, like you said, you are blocking traffic or moving slower than everyone else then you are being selfish for not allowing them to pass, especially if after a period of time you've ignored the signals from those around you that you are irritating them.  This is common respect for the feelings of others, and if I am in back of you and I notice that there is a long line of cars that YOU are holding up, then it IS about US and not you, and you should move the heck out of the way or speed up.  God help us if the world adopts these feel good seminars.  I don't want to feel so good that I am in denial about the world and my surroundings.  I understand the need to control one's ego, but I'm not sure it's the right thing to not make it about ""ME"" and make it about ""WE"" all the time.  By building my confidence, I am not threatened by anything or anyone, and understand that everyone else could be confident in the attributes and great spirit that God gave them.  I am then open to love by others.  We are individuals living in a very corrupt world.  I think you better have an ego to survive and effect positive change, or else you'll remain willfully, dangerously silent, as the never-sleeping bad guys encroach to tear the world down.  When I honk, you have placed yourself in front of common sense needs and sensibilities of generally accepted protocols of consideration for other drivers.  Please pull over for the rest of us!

-Reasons we talk things personally is because of ego and the desire to be right. 
-Solutions: 
1) It's not about me. Look at WE. What's their intention. understand where they are coming from . For example, they want to be right, maybe they have a call they have been waiting for. 

2)- deal with your negative beliefs. We take things personally because we know there is some truth in it. Big chance this is rooted in your childhood. So give yourself some empathy. 
3) By telling people how you feel without blaming others might increase the chance of people taking your feelings into account.

Remember whatever others do, you will always keep your value.",2021-06-24T08:03:48Z

@jeradclark6387,Is it your ego that gets upset when somebody’s not listening to you or paying attention to you when you’re talking to them ??(example turning on the TV when you’re talking to them )or is it common courtesy to listen to somebody why they’re talking to you and you understandably get upset because they’re not. That’s my take on it I don’t believe it’s the ego I believe it’s upset because you’re not getting the common courtesy that you would give to somebody else when talking to you ..what do you have to say about that referee?,2021-06-13T20:07:17Z

@TheLastInferno,"I was bullied a lot as a kid and as a teenager. I thought I made it out pretty well into adulthood. Recently though, I've made some friends who are also my coworkers who say very annoying things that leave me fuming for a few hours even after work. I take the things they say to heart; I take the things they say very personally. I thought I would have thicker skin because I survived all that bullying but it seems all those emotions were internalized and are leaking out, sometimes in short explosive bursts. 

I hate it so much because I fear I'm alienating them by perceiving certain things as disrespect when they really don't mean to be malicious (and I KNOW what malice is.) I just don't like regression. I can stand up for myself now, and it's as if I'm making up for all the times I didn't stand up for myself in my younger years. But, these are the wrong people to always be ""standing up to."" I need to be more cool minded. 

I know what I must do but it is very hard to execute it. Also, people's expectations of you drives you to behave with them in a certain way. They now see me as the easily offended, angry person so now it feels like I'm stuck. Oh well. God knows best.",2021-06-11T23:16:43Z

Yeah I do take things personally....and it does hurts...
The time when four of my friends went to the fair without asking me once....I took that personally.....
Whenever my girlfriend shares her sadness with our friend  but not me.....I took that personally....I thought I don't worth it.....I'm a bad lover.....I can't be good for anyone......and I never spoke or told anyone anything, I don't dare to. 
But today.....I just want to think....that maybe they didn't ask me cause they thought I wouldn't go(as I am not a very outgoing person).....
And maybe my gf finds it easier to share her story with our friend as she(our friend) gives amazing suggestions.....so she(my gf) can get out of her problem easily.......

Yeah there will be a lot of incidents that I'll take personally but I'll always say to myself that ""this is not about me"".....and if it's about me....then I'll work it out.....

Never listen to anyone who brings you down instead use it as a fuel for you to keep going and reach your goal in life. You matter. ❤️",2021-05-13T16:03:26Z

@ranjitsur6397,"It's all very good to not get bothered by what others say, especially criticism. But reality also shows there are lots of people around us, who criticise others just to abuse others or to disrepute others.. This can be very damaging especially when someone is pursuing his or her career or job. It is a fact that everyone is inside a social structure, be it a family or the workplace. So whatever someone is pursuing, if that becomes the target of relentless slander and abuse and false campaign it can very well lead to rejection of someone's good efforts, and can result in obstructing and altogether damaging someone's good prospect. 
What, the speaker is suggesting here can be helpful in an isolated surrounding or independent surrounding which does not in anyway depend on any kind of social support structure. For eg.  the speaker chose to be a referee. Now if he had been made a target of relentless criticism about his referring then the situation can so become that he may not be alloted any game to be referee. In such a situation you have to speak out and fight your case.",2021-05-03T03:33:33Z

@sunshinerainbows4627,"Interesting.  On my way to an appointment,  an older lady was both tail gaiting and flashing lights at me even though I was driving at the posted speed limit.
Her erratic  behavior caused me to wait for her to pass before changing lanes for my own safety.   Ironically I moved a few lanes over to reach an exit and when I Iooked in her direction she was going about the same speed, not faster.  A lesson in doing the right thing (driving correctly) no matter what another driver does.

@McLKeith,"Not a bad presentation. But he still takes the sense of self seriously. The sense of self is a fiction that we created when very small children. Douglas Harding wrote a book ""On Having No Head"" that explains it.",2021-05-02T02:13:43Z
@TheWRBM,"It's a very very simplified approach that isn't very concise. For example, with tail gating...it is about me (my safety on the road) and others too. It's about road safety. If it's about  being happy, I'm happiest if possible I can get the pursuant vehicle car number and let the police know. They are the ones that can sort out the tailgater and determine if they have a valid reason or not. Changing from ""they are harassing me"" to ""oh they might just be in a hurry"" are two sides of the same coin indeed. Both are dangerous cause you're making the judgement yourself. Hand it over to the people who are in place to make that judgement. That's real headspace control.",2021-05-02T02:11:13Z
@BMR86,"Here are my notes, as I am training to become a better professional and stop getting kicked off work teams

What is the strategy to not take things personally?
Our EGO doesn't want to be criticized 
Do you want to be right? Or HAPPY?
How to be come happy by NOT taking things personally?

2 strategies:

1. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME… me myself and I, look at it from the other person's perspective,
SHIFT MY FOCUS FROM ME TO WE
Try to see the intention of the other one I make space for understanding instead of irritation

 look at the other persons intention

2. IT IS ABOUT ME ... 
50,000 thoughts our brain produces per day, only 10,000 are positive 
GIVE YOURSELF SOME EMPATHY
SPEAK UP, tell the other one what's going on inside you

Summary:
How not to take things personally,
It is not about me, look at the other persons intention
If that doesn't work
Then it IS about me, GIVE YOURSELF EMPATHY AND SPEAK UP

The ""Do you want to be right?"" question is making me think of Dale Karnegie's book ""How to win friends and influence people""... But yes. I do want to be right. But only about the good things. For bad stuff, no thanks, I don't wanna be right for horrible things. So I choose to be rightfully happy and happily right. Wouldn't you be happy is someone supports your thoughts and agrees?

A lot of this touches on some of the things I had to face during CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) and definitely those techniques, those thought patterns resonate with me greatly.

But as you say, if you can step out from that apply one or both of those techniques, chances are that it was just a misunderstanding either by the other person, or by you.

@stourleykracklite7663,"14:57 ""By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one you increase the chance the other one will understand you and take your needs into account."" Or will the other one become defensive, having had their attention drawn, however gently, to the possibility that their conduct caused some harm? If I feel that the other one treated me disrespectfully and, with honesty and delicacy, I explain how I feel to that other (my boss) who disagrees with the validity of my emotions, how will that turn out? Especially if my boss believes my conduct was grossly damaging to the company or out of line with expectations? Now, I may retrospectively come to realize I was wrong in whole or part. Even so, my boss' reaction may have been wildly inappropriate- am I likely to receive from them acknowledgment of that? And even if what I did was per company protocol and the damages were wholly unanticipatable by myself, even if my boss could have and did not anticipate what would happen if an employee acting in good faith did not have the information or capabilities they had- would I be on the receiving end of their empathy?

@emmad7343,"In the book ""13 things mentally strong people don't do"" by Amy Morin there is also this topic . I think his strategies are valid but I would add one more, one that I've learned by reading the book I talked about earlier: try to rationalise what other people say about you. Why do they say what they say about you? If someone comes to you at work and says ""You are not working hard enough"" try to analyse what it means. Try to think if it's true. Analyse the hours of work, try to remember in which state of mind you are while working and if you are productive, try to think rationally to know if the other person is right and what is saying is true. If it's true then you should just think about it and try to become a better worker. If it's not true then you really don't have to bother about what the other person said because you analysed the way you work and you KNOW it's not true. In the case of a referee (even if during a match he doesn't really have the time to analyse everything the audience says) he could think about the way he took decisions. I hope this will bring you more confidence! Keep up!",2021-04-17T04:58:33Z

@kafirkafiri4394,When some one ask you why are you upset and you start telling them and they start looking here and there and in smartphone it is natural to take it personally. The best way not to take this personally is when they are upset approach them with a lot empathy and when they start talking open you smart phone and start enjoying some tik tok videos and start laughing and lets see how they feel 😂😂😂😂😂. Behave with then the same way they behave with you do it and you will see reality of peoples. Don't take on yourself the burden of being morally correct you are not special in 7 billion people and neither is other person.,2021-04-15T11:51:36Z

@mayakyen3695,"Do u want to be right? 
Me: no, I want to be MUTUALLY respected, and perhaps not be targeted  or used for someone else's selfish intentions. 

As an empath i put myself in other's shoes as often as blinking, It's first nature for me. 
So when someone cuts me off in traffic, I shrug it off. Yea, I may feel annoyed from being cut off in traffic because I'm thinking that could have been an accident! 
The annoyance lasts for a few moments then it gets shrugged off and I then feel grateful that it wasn't an accident n noone got hurt. My demeanor is pretty laid back, if a friend turns down an invite it may feel uncomfortable for a moment but then my mind starts thinking, hey sometimes I don't want to hang out with my peeps and just want to keep it in and enjoy my alone time... no harm no foul. 
 It takes great injustices to get me fired up.

*STRATEGY*
Consider their perspectives, consider their intentions.
It’s not about me huh..? 
Me to we! Oki
10:15
You have no clue what they are laughing at. You think they’re laughing at your new shoes, for  all you know eg they could be laughing at a funny looking insect on the floor! 
Look at it from their perspective.
10:55
Again.
It’s not about me.
_they just want to be right, to win_

11:42 

*STRATEGY 2! If strategy 1 does not work.*

Some really do hurt. Some really do question so it’s hard to think about from their perspective!
“I was driving too slowly..it was my fault that he was honking his horn”
Answer: ITS NOW ABOUT YOU!
13:12
HAHA I LOVE THIS EXAMPLE
Nothing in you believes that you are an orange!
Compared to
“You are selfish!”
Feeling hurt from this is mostly rooted from childhood :(
A raw nerve was hit? Give yourself...some empathy. Speak up about your vulnerabilities. 

Homework: take things personally, to put these into practice!
16:38
HE JUST
BAHAHA.
HE JUST ATE MONEY.
AND SPAT IT.
THATS 20 EUROS MAN-
17:10

Q: do you still want that 20 euros?
I- well y e a. That’s like 20 bucks! Can buy myself a whole subway! 2 of em!

""People may attack you, criticise you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk all over you, but remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value.""


Keep your head high! Your value will never, ever change! No matter what they do to you!

*SUMMARY.*

Strategy 1: it’s not about you! 
Me to We! Think of their intentions. It takes training to find them as positive intentions. You have n o idea what they are laughing about. Besides..who told you they were laughing at your shoes! That’s right. It’s an accumulation of one own negative thought of the other 39,999,999.

Strategy 2: ouch..:( 
“am I really that selfish?” 
When strategy 1 doesn’t work, it’s our resort to really think about the truth of it. 
Roots: childhood..? 
In this case is about you! Don’t beat yourself up. This has truly hurt you! An actual insecurity from again deeper roots! How could you control that. Here..open up. Be vulnerable. Tell them what you feel. They’ll most likely understand you. Tell them, without blaming them, how you truly felt.

Bad notes I know to another eye, but these will really help me reinforce to not take it personally. 

Thank you Frederick. I truly laughed and felt something indescribable <3",2021-04-10T00:32:19Z

@passport-photo,"It is next to impossible to open up - without blaming the other. The whole point why we get upset by another's actions is there infraction onto our core  value.. but those values are not universally shared - and values are created from who we are and our childhoods. Therefore opening up and explaining that we are upset by another actions ultimately leads to blame - as the other does not feel that their action encroaches on your value set, or sometimes that you even had the right to the value in the first place, hence the blame and disagreement. Example. Someone honking behind you because you drive too slow. Ok. My value is driving carefully because my parents taught me to be diligent. This person is honking at me as he doesn't acknowledge my diligence as a value. He honks. Now I remember my brother and I have a problem with  authority figures - I did nothing wrong = being upset. I did take his horning at me personally as I feel I didn't do anything wrong and was keeping to the speed limit - the other person saw an open road and was upset as he perceived no risk from driving faster. Yes it was about my childhood, my values as I don't think I did anything wrong based on my values. If I were to explain this to him... it would be next to impossible to do so with out blaming him for honking in the first place...",2021-04-09T22:29:17Z

@JdotCarver,"Basically:
Be less insecure: By knowing your weaknesses you need to work on, and your strengths you can feel confident about.
Be more empathetic: By listening to what the other wants, why are they saying that.
Be more vulnerable: Speak up. Say what's on your mind.
All in all, just be a better human being. Being paranoid means being insecure. Fighting paranoia is just covering the symptoms not the cause.

All this is pretty standard stuff if you're acquainted with Jordan Peterson.",2021-04-05T14:12:10Z

Than you alsk can not take that out is about me... But not much i can  correct myself. Many people take being mini aggressive is their defense pattern.. I keep on trying see others perspectives and if something i need to learn or can do but. Emotionally at times one need understanding and feel alone and guilty.

@nv7287,"3:57 A loved one walking away while you are trying to tell them something that is important to you...
Hmmmmm Sure it has part to do with ego (it's not always about being right though!), but also I think it is fair to be disappointed in them! TV at that point surely is less important than having the chance to talk over a situation together?... It's true as a person you always keep value if you believe in yourself but... Is it not fair to hope and expectation, that your partner will let you talk through your fears, hopes frustrations? Not because they are always aligned, but because they are important to you? And therefore also important markers as a partnership, with a view to both understanding each other with open communication and respect?

At the end of the day we are all alive for the first time - so we make mistakes!
(I say this with humour since I don't believe in any other lifetime, you can if you want I don't need you theories)

But sometimes I think, there is a very good reason to take an action personally!
Not instantly as a flash reaction, but if after digging for reasons with them it still doesn't add up.",2021-03-30T20:39:13Z
@JJDoggett,"Great talk, simple lessons but hard to put into practice. I used to struggle a lot with this when I was younger, but now I usually manage to take a step back and keep in mind that we simply cannot control other people's thoughts, words or actions and operating under the futile belief that we can just makes us miserable.

If someone criticises your project, take on board the learning to do better in future but still reflect on how you did a good job. If someone gets angry at you for a small thing that you didn't mean and it's blown out of proportion that's down to them and not you. If someone rejects you for a date then they either don't think you're a good match or they don't see your value, either way that's no reflection on you. Remember none of us is perfect and we all make mistakes. Also remember you are always valued, even in the unlikely event that you are the only person who truly values you that's still one person! 

Appreciate the football analogies here too, although either the insults were toned down to be acceptable in a TED talk or the league this man refs in is exceptionally polite.

@shannonmccarthy4000,"if you don't - calmy, non-aggressively - be verbal and communicate clearly how you're thinking/feeling if someone hurts you or something goes wrong, the other person/people will likely never know about how you're feeling or the situation and so won't know or understand. Don't assume the other person can read your mind or is thinking/seeing things exactly as you do. It may be someone else's responsibility for their words if they said or did something harsh or mean to you, but you're the only one who is ultimately responsible for managing your feelings and thoughts afterwards. It's you're responsibility to do what you need to protect yourself (and others), be heard and be vocal (non-abusively) about your issues, so they have more of a chance of being solved.

If the other person then doesn't listen, deny or straight up ignores you, then that's a separate issue. Again, not to take personally. Don't immediately assume they fight you because they are trying to be an enemy to you. Take a moment to BREATHE (it's always important to remember to control your breathing when frustrated or anxious) and consider there may be other factors - which you may or may not be aware of - that mean they aren't able to listen to you or agree with you, and it may not be their (or even your) fault. But AGAIN, this can't be solved unless you're VOCAL, OPEN, show some EMPATHY (to yourself as well as the other person), and COMMUNICATE. Also though, give some BREATHING SPACE for yourself and the other person, and don't pressure someone or let someone pressure you into talking until both you and the other feel okay to.",2021-03-27T22:24:47Z

@berijeux,"Many times I’ve been thinking, when for instance a driver honks at you or yells at you for doing X or Y, and you want to react strongly (insult, shout, come to hands), they’re not yelling at YOU.
They’re yelling at the RANDOM person that was in this very place at this very moment. They’re yelling at a situation.
They would have yelled at ANYONE that would have been in your place.

When you see some driver honk or yell at somebody ELSE, do you still want to insult, shout, come to hands? No? And yet, it’s the EXACT same situation.

P.S.: imagine you suddenly realize that this driver you want to punch is somebody you like very much (friend, cousin, aunt, uncle). How would you then react? Calm down and have a friendly chat with them, if not hug them? Or still want to punch them?",2021-03-27T06:48:36Z

@whoareyou6211,"I'm taking things personally all the time. I'm sensitive and overthink alot, that everything's my fault. It's so easy to explain that, yet for the whole time it was hard for me to figure it out. I don't have friends in my class and I never know when it's my fault or not, because everytime I do something wrong, I get critisized and yelled at by them, convincing me I hurt them, or in most cases, for example, ruined the game, when I did something wrong in P.E. while playing football. When I told my family about my problems, they keep telling me it's not about me, and I agree. But everytime I do something wrong and get critisized, it takes time to realize if I actually did something wrong or they're just complaining and I never know how to answer. I always get scared of doing or saying something wrong, so I stay quiet in class. This video is basically about everything that I'm having troubles with. I'm glad I watched it, but I also know these methods don't work at the first try. The fact that I'm sensitive, overthink and take things personally, they're all just part of my personality and it takes time and practice to make things easier. Also it'd be better for me in my situation to have a friend around who could support me at any time (i only have online friends and overall friends who aren't in my class). 
But overall thank you for this video. This means alot to me.",2021-03-26T20:38:38Z

1. - losing your self importance is key.
2. - dont have a position to defend.
 - given these two choices you will gravitate towards truth & kindness anyway because you dont have any ego to maintain, which is draining. If you find that you are doing or saying things that seem to make little sense, just ask yourself if this is you ego - your self-importance - talking.",2021-03-24T13:50:08Z

Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating which means the Market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others Still continue to trade without the fear of making loss, others are been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signal. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me , I started with 1.5 BTC and I have accumulated over 6.7BTC within 3 weeks with the trading strategies given to me by Expert Blian Reinkensmeyer His method are top notch and profitable, obviously he's the best.

@1ceb0xcfbl,"Because there is no ME as an individual (nor there's such a thing as ""WE""), there is I. And I are all of us. But not as individuals. Just as I. We are all points of consciousness, but we are the same source of that said consciousness. If you see it that way, you will never take things presonally because there is no individual nor person. There's nothing to take. But it's difficult to break the spell when all our lives we've been taught that we're all different.",2021-03-19T12:28:36Z

@justynsullivan8466,"The fact is, Cryptocurrency is making financial waves and fighting against poverty in this modern era, and the question traders as them self is if this the right time to invest ? Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating which means the Market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others Still continue to trade without the fear of making loss, others are been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signal.

@wongawonga1000,"I had an experience relatively recently when not taking things personally required the greatest self mastery. For 6 months,I'd been working on  a document in a highly specialized field. The man who reviewed what I'd written was undoubtedly  a world leader in this narrow subject of interest on which there are no text books or websites to obtain reference information. So, rather than receiving his review comments in written form, a meeting was organised where I got a verbal summary of his negative views (i.e. I'd comprehensively stuffed it up)in front of my work colleagues. In my 20 year career as an engineer, this had to be the most humiliating experience ever. I left the meeting feeling shell shocked. When looked at through the perspective of time, the entire task I'd been working on seemed absurd. Asking someone to reproduce results accurately in several months to reflect what others had made entire careers working on. I was essentially setup to fail. Admittedly I made mistakes in how I approached the task. I don't blame the reviewer for his negative comments - I'm certain he was correct in every instance.",2021-03-17T07:13:33Z

@Nostrum84,"Core message at 14:59.
In general I feel like I am very open with my feelings (unless it is towards a woman then I am just awkward LOL). I voice my opinion, I voice my feelings, and I can say it openly, both when put on the spot and when not put on the spot. What the problem, I think, is that in many cases that sounds like _complaining_ and _blaming_ . I am very *bad* at saying these things without being hurtful in some sense. I want to avoid attacking others, but it almost always happens. I don't know how to do it and I think this is biggest problem.
Apart from that, yes I feel hurt a lot as well. It's probably rooted in childhood, no idea where exactly though. I have come to the conclusion that to some extent I probably enjoy getting frustrated so that I have something to vent about? Not sure if it's true, but it would be an explanation for why I'd stay in the same work place or situation for so long if I know that it's bad for me. I'm scared of not being able to find something new, I guess....?! I'm scared of not being good enough. Scared of wasting time although I'm wasting time.",2021-03-16T21:11:46Z

@ryanhurd9649,"This is like my 10th time watching this video. Honestly, one of my most favorite TedTalk cuz it helps me remember that True Love is about being patient and working hard in wanting what is best for the other person, and not just selfishly wanting to keep the good feelings with that person. When we get bad feelings from a person, we can always take it personally and forget that we need to love them. This guy is honestly a legend for sacrificing his money income and his job just to learn how to not take things personally. And his voice is really nice and gentle and it motivates me to be the same when I grow up :) I share this with a lot of my friends too, and honestly, they probably won't watch it cuz they will take it personally but I always remember that it isn't about me. I send them that video cuz I care for them. And if they hate me then that's fine. I just don't want personal hate for their friends at least. Even Jesus was hated by an entire empire for his act of True Love. But he never took it personally because he knew that his value as a God-Given person can never be knocked down by hate. I believe that everyone's inner holy spirit can have a beautiful masterpiece where they can selflessly serve each other cuz of love.",2021-03-16T05:40:13Z

@TomZart,"ADVERSITY, FRIENDS & MORE !
There's no better teacher in life
Like the troubles which come our way.
Adversity strengthens our minds
As we pray what to do and say.

Constant success shows but one side
Of the world we find ourselves in.
Adversity teaches us all
That people love, hate, war and sin.

Adversity and hardships bring us closer together
When trust is the source of our every need.
As we count on truth and heed Its will
We overcome foulness, temptation and greed.

For those who suffer from adversity
There's nothing like the support of a true friend.
We see their concern for our afflictions
As their eyes turn red and tears descend.

THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ??

@ChristopherSalisburySalz,"I think it has a lot to do with self-awareness.  Usually, the more self-aware you are the more likely you are to take things personally.  You already know that you have several flaws and shortcomings and so when someone attacks one of them it hurts.  The upside to self-awareness is empathy, you can be more gentle with others because you understand how it feels to be criticized and vulnerable. I think the most confident people are either nearly flawless or have a total lack of self-awareness.",2021-03-12T19:31:31Z

However, one thing irritates me, but it seems to me that the problem is not on my side.
I am irritated when I have to solve a problem, the solution of which I know and I am explaining it, and someone cuts in while still thinking what the answer may be. I think that maybe this person doesn't hear me or ignores me on purpose, but when I stop talking then he suddenly apologizes and asks me to finish because it is a good idea and then we all stand in silence and I say that I am done because when two people of speaking at the same time nothing clear will come out.

As  much as our individual lives rely on people - it matters what those people think of us. We can rationalize it’s not about us or work on self acceptance to feel less upset / insulted  when we are judged or dismissed but the fact is we are sensitive to the judgments of others and commensurate with the extent to which we value that person we will take their direct or indirect estimation of us  personally because we are wired to do so. This personal reaction is ultimately prosocial behavior and actually helps us survive and continue developing.

If that saves one's life, use it! Use all the tools you got. Until then, do be happy, and don't fight for being right!!! :) I will stop when I feel fully safe. When I have a job that covers my expenses, when I have a safe place to stay that I can afford, when I have food to put in my mouth. Then and only then I will be silent, like I always have been and be nothing! Hopefully that will be soon! No one will hear about me unless professionally.

@BelleEFlopp-nk5xe,"Any advice on how to take positive attention and compliments? 🥱😆 I will always need improvement to not take things personally, as will everyone else in this world. But what works for me is that no one can tell me something critical about myself that I’m not already aware of and have on my list of things to improve. On the opposite side, I feel weird when people give me real compliments (not the kind from a man yelling something inappropriate, those kind are entertaining). But I don’t know how to respond. I instantly have this feeling the person is putting themselves below me, leaving me feeling selfish and stuck up all because they said I’m really pretty. I know it sounds silly, but I’m a Libra. I’m all about that balance. I hate confrontation. I adapt in situations, going against what I truly want, in order to create peace with someone. To be clear, I don’t lack confidence and I like knowing someone has nice thoughts about me... but when they say it, I get weird 😒",2021-03-09T02:28:47Z

On times, electrifying. When it finished, we all applauded. Then the conductor asked if we really enjoyed it, and we called out to him that we had. Then he told us that they'd found the experience dis- concerting, because we'd stayed quiet throughout the performance- which apparently experienced audiences do not do - that they were used to audience exuberance throughout their performances! Their relief at discovering that we thought it was actually fantastic and would definitely go to another was palpable - they laughed and played us a bit extra, and this time, we let them know how much we had enjoyed it and their faces, beamed at our beaming faces!
That was a lesson in how we can feel lesser, even when we are greater, due to nothing more than a lack of understanding/communication. We have to somehow at least give ourselves a break at least half the time - we're usually better than we think we are!",2021-03-07T17:07:36Z

@caesq_r,"(Summary?)
taking his example of the project sharing, where A shares his project to B, but B goes on his smartphone
We should consider all the **possible** intentions of B when he looks at his smartphone:

B wants to take notes about your project, and/or
B wants to check if she/he recieved an important email
(etc...)
**B wants to show you that he/she doesn't care about your project**

There are so many possibilities! but, we often decide to believe that last one, because of our ego. Though, it can be that first one, or that second one, or both, or etc.

So, before thinking anything, we need to first comprehend the true intention of the other person, and not comprehend what we think his/her intention is.

(as showed in the video,   -""Look at the other person's intention first"")


Another example is: Why is nobody laughing at the presentator's jokes?
it might be because his jokes are not funny
it might be because his presentation is boring
[...]
**it might be they are concentrated on his presentation**

There are solutions to spot out the other person's true intention:
Tell the other person how you are feeling after hearing her/his words basing on the intention you believe they have, and they will probably tell you their real intention if the intention you believe is wrong (try do this without accusing the other)

And if the other doesn't seem to care about your feelings, then let's ask them directly: ""What's your intention?""

@FaceInTheCrowd,"Good speech. Presented in a way I'm not used to, it kept my interest.
I didn't really realise it but now you've exposed it I see I've been using that strategy to cope with life for some years now and it really works!
I see myself as very self-critical and flipping my view to understanding that other people also have agendas in life calms me down when I feel unappreciated, mocked or criticised by others.
Yes, there are things I can change about me, my approaches, the way I handle a situation, but by empathising with another's responses I can learn to improve my own actions.
I'm a father to an autistic child and I am learning every day how to deal with his responses. It's a challenge and it helps me to cope with interactions with other people in my life as well.
Thankyou for laying out the strategy - it really does help.",2021-03-04T11:01:33Z

My granddaughter's teacher had a sign on the door where the last line had been changed to ""...but words can hurt forever.""

In other words, kids are now taught to make every insult last for as long as they can or until someone else offends you even more deeply.

At 66 I might not be around long enough to see the end results of our current cancel culture where it seems everyone takes everything personally,

But then again, maybe The End is just around the corner, as the prognosticators of doom have been predicting for millenia.

In any case, all I can say to the proponents of the notion that no one should ever contradict anyone and thereby run the risk of hurting their feelings is ""Good luck with that.""",2021-02-23T14:43:59Z

It's funny because you obviously see the patterns of it on others, but when its on yourself, its a lot harder than you think. You know you took it personally when it already happened and sometimes it already had an impact, which can be complicated.

This is a daily exercise. I loved it. I work hard on this every and each day. I strive to be better at this, because it's just like Frederik said: sometimes those are things that hurt your ego, but they shouldn't when they're not really about you. 

Thank you for your wise words. It's funny because it felt so obvious, but still so mind-opening, because even the obvious sometimes needs to be said so it can be really acknowledged. The world doesn't turn around you or me. Deal with it.",2021-02-23T02:27:33Z

@ejc1692,"I needed this. I like that he acknowledges being vulnerable and speaking up in hurtful situations - too many people, including myself, would keep silent and let resentment fester to ""keep peace"" when it is actually the opposite. It is because I have been threatened and told that I take things too personally simply for acknowledging my humanity when it's violated, no matter how graciously it is handled. Whether or not someone values me as an equal human being means nothing to the truth of being one.

Taking things personally means internalizing someone else's action and taking blame for it by lashing out in anger or indifference. Giving one the benefit of the doubt must be balanced with knowing the other person and using intuition to gauge that person's intentions and using discernment in whether the relationship is worth the effort or if it's more appropriate to ignore and walk away from a narcissist. 

We cannot control nor demand others' actions yet we can control and command how those actions affect us, what we will accept and put our own peace first. Please don't mistake his message for accepting anything and everything and tolerating abuse; rather, it is about not giving our God-given power away and owning our own self-worth. 🙏",2021-02-22T22:13:26Z

On the other hand, bad people are angry; negative, fault finding, blame mongering revengeful ppl, all out to put down anyone who ""is the cause of their angst"". How do you ""keep your value""  before such ppl?  Or rather; don't you sometimes lose that value if, in trying to keep it, you  let them ""swallow/spit you,   kick you, mud you and what-have-you"".

@erinevermay8926,"I found this video so helpful.  It also made me think about how we are often bothered and take things personally when the comments are negative, yet if they are positive, we feel happy and complimented.  Maybe to become more balanced we also need to learn not to take the positive comments personally.  eg. if you do a favour for someone, they are happy and say, ""thank you, you are amazing!"" and we feel good.  But if you don't do that favour, they may not have the same response.  Of course we can still feel good about compliments, but remaining level-headed and understanding that the same principle may apply, aka ""it's not about us, it's about them"".",2021-02-04T23:42:39Z

Now here one thing to be noted in my opinion ...!
This man is a refree...👍
Why he became refree it also have a deep meaning...!😊
how he is now presenting and teaching us is seeming very ideal...!
💐💐💐💐💐💐
Before he decided to give this presentation he wouldn't have idea how perfectly he could present..!
But according to me what  has he learned in his life this experience is very helpful to millions of people...!

@chiaral8516,I think `wanting to be right` is not the same thing as taking things personally and is overemphasized here. Its only certain personality types whose egos have that goal of being right -- other people have different ego priorities. Some of the other things you talked about like recognition and being taken into account by others are probably more universal.,2021-01-31T15:20:31Z

@AnnaBarrowMusic,I work in a prison as an officer and you wouldn’t believe the verbal abuse that comes with the job. Part of my journey that has made me grow up so much in the past year is learning to not take it personally. People project what they feel about themselves. And when I do get hurt by their words “It is a matter of what I have not come to terms with myself yet”. So I take my reaction as a guide to what I need to learn to accept or assume responsibility for changing.,2021-01-31T12:51:44Z

YouTube so I started thinking about it) and he told me that when are you going to stop thinking about these small thing and the small amount of money you get from it I got really hurt that he told that my feeling are ""SMALL"" and the money part just broke me. Now what bothering me is that is he right or am I right if he is right should I say that can you please talk nicely to me  I fear that he will say that I like to say things bluntly.

And I think he did it in not taking things personally himself! Great speaker~
What also inspired me in this talk, apart from not taking things personally as an individual, people also need to reflect on their ways of judging others and make more respect for the world. Keep a balance in expressing oneself and understanding others~ Good luck on our journey in living a happier life!",2021-01-27T05:55:56Z

But remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value.” - This just hit me so hard. When I take things personally, I always get mad and  sometimes fight back ( argue) with the person talked about me (of course things got worse) but after realizing what he said, the more I fight back the more value I lost (wasting my time and becoming more toxic, harmful person).

@borgoat1220,"4:46 ""It's our ego.""
It's not ""ego."" It's self-esteem. There's a difference. ""Ego"" is conceit, while self-esteem is self-worth. As a hypothetical example, if someone's friends exclude her/him from an activity, that person who's excluded may feel slighted and suffer a loss in self-esteem. That person who's excluded may feel she/he is not good enough or worthy of inclusion. That hurts. It's actually ""ego"" for the friends doing the excluding because on some level, they erroneously believe they're in a more stable social position than the excluded friend due to their being in the ""in-group,"" and they may be too blinded by ""ego"" to realise their self-delusion. But of course, they're the ones who are obviously in a less stable social position because ""in-group"" is fragile and inevitably collapses as one by one, the members of the ""in-group"" leave to do other things. In contrast, the excluded person who enjoys her/his own company, loves her/himself, and can have fun on her/his own need not worry about social stability because in a group of one, she/he can never be thrown out or left behind, and she/he has full control over her/his happiness and feel self-assured that that happiness does not depend on validation from others. And that's the foundation of truly resilient, long-lasting self-esteem.",2021-01-20T06:50:12Z

One day I asked a seasoned performer if he knew why the audience wasn’t clapping or being more vocal... he told me that the when a performance is so good, the audience is captivated by the presentation that they don’t think to clap or show emotion. It all makes sense because at the end of every show we would get a standing ovation. Crazy how that works. And in the theater world being quite is good etiquette as well.

Maybe the person was raising this seeing how I'm always so reserved and unconfident ... Or it is about me...

In the case of this referee example, he WAS doing the players a ""favour"" by making sure the game is played according to the rules, rules in which both sides agreed on. But those who want to win without playing by the rules get angry. They simply don't deserve his ""favour"", or even the right to play. These bad players have a ""perceived justice"" a.k.a. ""u let me win = justice"", yet we know ""true justice"" is when everyone play by the rules fairly and win.

So, in conclusion: learn what ""true justice"" is, don't go and perceive your own version of what justice is, coz ""true justice"" is / should be appreciated by everyone, even when we are human and sometimes just don't do so.",2021-01-14T05:52:16Z

My interpretations:
* Know it’s not about you. 
* INVESTIGATE/UNDERSTAND the other person’s intent behind their actions (or lack of intent to harm you)
* Recognize that you may feel personally affected because of some underlying need / precondition / inclination you have (e.g. need for praise, acceptance, etc). In which case have EMPATHY for yourself. 
* Communicate HOW you FEEL (objectively describe how you felt when they said/did something--without attacking/blaming the person). This will increase the odds of the person factoring in your feelings and also have empathy for you.
* No matter what people say or do at/to/around you, you will never lose your value. Like a dollar bill.",2021-01-04T21:34:57Z

It takes a lot of effort and discipline for us to re-shape our thoughts 2) ironically, this is about me at the end(my insecurity) because you are in self doubt when you are taking others personally. There are chances that this feeling is rooted in your childhood. Give yourself empathy to embrace yourself. 3) Speak up for yourself. Tell others what you feel (without blaming others)",2020-12-30T04:35:05Z

@lauralupu4252,"Today is my birthday and because of the pandemic I am not able to celebrate my birthday with friends and family. Usually, I would plan something in advance and I would go out with all of them to have a nice dinner. But this year, I haven't been in touch with them so much and I haven't communicated my plans in advance (to remind them of my birthday) beacause I couldn't make a birhday party this year. And to my surprize, a lot less people wished me happy birthday this year. Just my very best friends and close family members reached to me. I took it very personally. I did not expected this. But then I tried thinking that it is my birthday and I have to enjoy it, and that enjoyment needs to come from myself and not be something that I have to receive from others. (Tge apreciation from others should be just a bonus and nothing more) And then this video poped up and I feel a little better now. So, for whoever is reading this, don't take things personally.

@CricketKS,"Question: how do you practice this (like you did being a referee) when you can't psyche yourself up before the proverbial game? I have a few meetings at work where I can psyche myself up, but in my personal life and general work life ""attacks"" come out of left field"" and generally act as daggers straight to the heart.

Scenario: the repeated situation that hurts the most is my Motger-in-laws comments since my daughter was born 2.5 years ago (& my husband's default to agree with her because ""he is not all knowing"" & apparently his mother is, and thus my family's p.o.v. and my own research is dung--I should be strung up and beaten for offering an infant organic store-bought baby food or using Water Wipes instead of a full on bum bath with every diaper... the list goes on)

In terms of your video, I am trying to prepare myself for future encounters (& the birth of my next child which gives me anxiety attacks for the reasons above)

1. It's not about you. It's about them... she does have an unresolved chronic anxiety problem. In her culture and family, giving advice sounds a lot more like criticism and demands (especially when you respectfully decline that advice and screaming matches ensue for the next several conversations until you comply)... this is reason #2 my husband takes her side--not worth what she puts people through when they disagree with her. (Hmmm, so maybe I should turn into a screaming banshee to get my way? Nope, I don't like yelling and in instances when I do, my husband's not a fan, either.)

2. It is about me. ABSOLUTELY I was 💯 percent insecure about being a first time mom. My husband always tells me to have more confidence,  but then undermines that statement by cow towing to the all-knowing matriarch. I'm prepared to stand my ground, give myself empathy, even consider the advice part of the screaming outbursts of anxiety (I greatly respect her and much of her advice, I just have deep scars from the wounds inflicted when I was at my most vulnerable).

3. This one's hard, but I think it might be key. I need to remember that even if the people closest to me--truly, my whole support system locally--treat me like dirt, my value hasn't changed. I hope that this will be the key to not struggling deeply with suicidal thoughts post partum because I don't think my toddler could receive my best care if I hit that stage again.

Oh, and I do speak up, but it has become one of the worst recurring fights of my marriage. I never feel heard, or understood when it comes to his mom & I get that it's hard for him. Lately I have felt that if my confidence level goes up and he repeats behavior from the first time around, I don't know if our marriage will recover from that. If I see my value and the people around me keep crumbling, spitting, stepping, discarding... I'm not sure how that will work.

Potential answer: I do try to psyche myself up before seeing them. I try to prepare the house and clothes for my daughter in a way that is above reproach and then still steel myself for the ""attacks"" but I have found that it has made me a bitter cynic, and, as I mentioned briefly, these people are the closest people to me physically and emotionally right now. This also impacts the way my husband sees me and he'll say things like ""maybe we need to keep you away from them while you work on your heart"" (another trigger) ...I care about them which is why it hurts worse when ""attacks"" come--I just want to feel approval, not like everything would be better for everyone without me.",2020-12-20T15:50:24Z

All so true.
I can see that it is not about me, but I take it further, finding out precisely what is it.
I try to figure out the latent origin in them.
People exhibit behaviour out of inner state of self, compounded to a feeling, emerging another feeling.
I try to work out backwards , to recognize the inner state of self.
Example
If someone is angry at you, it could be the product of his inner self state of frustration compounded to immediate feeling of jealousy.",2020-12-18T18:54:25Z

Well I’ll also say this here...investment is one of the best ways to ways to achieve financial freedom..As a beginner there are many challenges you’ll face. It’s hard to know how to get started. Trading the crypto market has really been a life changer for me. I almost gave up on cryptocurrency at some point not until I got a proficient broker Davi to handle my trades..I made more profits than I could ever imagine.. I’m not here to converse much but to share my testimony.. I have made total Returns of about 5.6BTC from an investment of just 0.95BTC.. All thanks to Mr Jax and his team, I’m really grateful especially during the lockdown they never disappointed me. I have been able to make great returns trading with Mr Jax which is one of the best trading platforms around. I discovered that I made more income than what my current job pays. I also urge you to take a bold step by giving the Bitcoin market a trial if you really want to make more money. You can reach him via Whats_Ap.⬇️  +  1 7  1  4  3  8  4  6  7  2  6

@weroleoify,"This forced isolation forced me to stare into myself. Never really got the saying ""stare into the abyss long enough and the abyss stares back"" and I still don't know if it alludes to what I interpreted.

I am incredibly prideful and when in a talk a friend that is like a big brother to me made me see I'm not as high and mighty, but rather fragile emotionally it caused a shock in me that made me cry for whole nights and even suicidal thought came in, my whole world broke, my truth was a lie...
Today I fixed most of my issues and can't be happier to be alive even in this wretched year.

I guess my advice is when you're at the bottom and can't see the path anymore its time to create a new one, those few crushing moments in life is when you use that sliver of determination left, use it to hold on for dear life and endure those moments, cause inevitably you will bounce up. Now when bouncing back you decide what to do with that inertia if you go down the same path or you change.
Hang in there people, determination and effort fails no one.

We've all heard the iconic: ""it gets better"", and yeah, it does, don't believe me? Well millions of people having gone through and won against adversity saying this must have some truth behind their words.",2020-12-14T17:10:45Z

@neelbhandari4090,"Summary :
1. It's not about me- Think about the intentions of the other person 
E.G- In a football match when you make a refereeing decision, people don't agree and then start screaming at you, it's not about you, it's about them wanting to be right.
2. The constant need to feel like it's about you comes from a sense of insecurity of not being good enough. Practicing every time to not think it's about you at every critical juncture helps.
3. If you always think it is about you, draw on empathy for yourself and have a self aware discussion with yourself that sometimes you can make mistakes
4. Be empathetic and vulnerable so it's easier for you to know your needs as well as for people to understand where you are coming from.",2020-12-10T07:57:04Z

What an intelligent concept. They should have thanked you for that. I am thanking you for that.  Noone should be scared where they live. Planned parenthood is also absolutely correct as well.  When i was growing up there were 3 or 4 billion people, now it is truely at an absurd rate to the point of overpopulation problems.  many sports people are operating on primal instincts which is so primitive that it is unpleasant and it is really sad because this plays a role in the mental health of this country.  To all you people living in an ivory tower, you have no idea what the struggle is like. I don't know if this covid is a reflection of too many people and God stepping in and saying read proverbs and what i said about letting to many foreigners into the zone and then tell me i didn't say i told you so.  peace love and happiness to all that know how to tune in and tune out.",2020-12-06T16:03:32Z

@Tassie-Devil,"All very well... but if ""it's not about me"" - then it can't be about ""you"" either.  You who want to overtake me, even though I am doing the speed limit.  

WHAT made your needs (or anxiety or anger or itinerary = 'YOU') more important than mine (= ME)?
By promoting your (apparent) needs above mine, you HAVE made this about me, because in your eyes I am an obstacle = a non-person, to your needs being met.

Very sorry, but _I_ see this as a democratic COMMUNITY... where we are equally important.  Once you start promoting yourself as the centre of the universe, I have to push back -if only for my own self respect-  against your selfish behaviour.",2020-12-05T02:08:17Z

Fui a ver a un médico y me hicieron muchos análisis de sangre, más tarde me dijeron que tenía herpes.  Mi médico me dijo que no hay cura para el herpes Me sentí mal, busqué en línea una posible cura para el virus del herpes, vi una publicación del Dr. Amenze, un médico a base de hierbas que está ayudando a las personas a curarse del VIH, HEPATITIS B, CÁNCER, etc.  Me comuniqué con él y le dije cómo me sentía. Dijo que su medicina herbal puede curarme.  Me envió el medicamento y yo recibí el medicamento unos días después de que él lo envió, tomé el medicamento según lo prescrito por él.  Antes de completar la medicación, los síntomas cesaron.  Fui al médico y me hice otro análisis de sangre, sorprendentemente salí negativo.  Ya no he tenido ningún síntoma.

@nadiagonzalez7852,"Este video me parece muy interesante porque en el minuto 4:53 nos dice que no debemos de tomarnos las cosas personales, es decir, que no les tomemos tan personales, porque nuestro ego piensa que los demás deben de tener en cuenta, pero este no quiere ser criticado, es decir que solo exista el, que no haya otro, por lo tanto, este necesita ser reconocido. en otro aspecto se plantea la pregunta de ¿qué es tener la razón? esta es, por así decirlo pérdida de tiempo porque nos hace estar en constante riña con los demás, además de que ¿no será mucho más fácil no tomarse las cosas tan personales? y hay que reflexionar acerca de esta cuestión, es decir que, si no se toman tanto las cosas personales, podemos tener una vida más armónica, más amena, y con más paz. después de todo esto Frederick en el minuto 5:49 se plantea algunas preguntas: ¿quieres ser feliz o tener la razón? ¿cómo ser feliz sin tomarse las cosas personales? aquí debemos de estar conscientes de que es lo que sucede al momento de tomarse las cosas tan personales, es decir, solo estamos pensando en nosotros, y en realidad no disfrutamos la vida, porque estamos en constante disgusto con los demás y debemos de aprender a que esto no suceda así. además de que debemos de tomar otra perspectiva, es decir ponernos en el lugar del otro. En el minuto 9:30 Frederick dice que la mayoría de las personas tendemos a tener siempre pensamientos negativos. y por último Frederick nos dice que no debemos de tomarnos las cosas tan personales porque se trata de empatia para los demás, y hablar correctamente de esta situación. 318035042 GCNM",2020-12-01T23:28:15Z

@stephaniegiovannaordunacha5440,"Muchas veces nos tomamos las cosas personalmente, y es muy importante aprender a no hacerlo siempre que analicemos el caso: puede ser que no se trate de mi, pues las otras personas también tienen una vida y en sus circunstancias, lo que “nos hicieron” (nota aquí: ¿por qué culparlos de cómo nos sentimos?) lo pudieron haber hecho por determinadas circunstancias (por ejemplo: citas previas, experiencias previas, etc.)
Pero cuando, a pesar de saber que no se trata sobre mi, lo sigo tomando personal, tenemos un problema de inseguridad propia, un problema que tenemos que arreglar, debemos trabajarlo y, claro, ayuda mucho externarle a la otra persona cómo nos sentimos pero sin culparla, para que pueda entendernos y, por qué no, hasta ayudarnos a trabajar nuestro problema.
Algo que me gustaría agregar es que toda crítica, por muy mala que sea, siempre debe ser reflexionado de forma crítica, pues no podemos decirnos todo el tiempo que nosotros tenemos la razón de nuestro sentir sea o no culpa del otro sujeto. Debemos aprender también a identificar qué cosas podemos mejorar, y aprender a identificar cuando una persona realmente critica sólo por molestar.

A basic book is ""Guide to Rational Living"". I ""practice"" the principles in that and other work by Ellis. As for not taking things personally, a common unconscious mistake is : I must have other people's approval. I should get acknowledged.The beginning of being grounded in your own shoes is self acceptance. Like the value the lecturer talks about that cannot be taken away. Also I  prefer to get approval but I don't ""need it"" . Another aspect of any new skill or habit, is doing it ,practicing it enough that it becomes part of oneself, a new habit. The science of habit (there are TED lectures and the the book ""The Power of Habit"" ) says it takes a minimum of 30 days ""in a row"" up to ""90 days"" to solidify a new habit.

@tommie3700,"So true. 
Someone once stole my bag, wallet and all, out of a locker that I didn't lock but left shut. I was passing by it all the time since it was right outside a room I was helping set up (it was in a uni building). The week before my psych reminded me to remember that most people don't do things TO you - how many times have you deliberately done something TO someone, and was it because YOU were feeling a certain way? She also reminded me that the bigger I blow up the threat, the bigger the blow to my ego - the whole, how could something so terrible have happened to me? 

So when I found my locker completely empty, I'm so glad that I knew that, because I was only in my ""no no no no how could this have happened to me, what did I do to deserve this?!"" mind for a few seconds before I remembered what she said. *That it wasn't about me. It was an easy opportunity, like most robberies. And, it would have happened to anyone that did the same thing.* That one mindset shift let me move on and tackle the issue before he could spend any more of my money.",2020-11-28T09:53:05Z

@equantrnql,"great start - but then you fizzle out. because you mix messages and don't use the the right analogy, or stick to it.  And, too dramatic. this kind of serious topic can be better relayed to an audience, if the narrator doesn't dramatize.  Because when you start to dramatize, you are already taking too personally (your effectiveness of the relaying of this important message). Nevertheless, a good attempt (even for a public speaker).",2020-11-27T19:07:45Z
@FrancesShear,Now I get it. When trying to accomplish something on my own under all of the cameras then all I need to do is not take it personally when I don't get it right away. It is not my fault then being underserving of being there. That way I will not attract attention from others who might then take it personally for allowing me with a disability to be there with them too in the first place when they see how I am over reacting and being so hard on myself when I am not getting it right away when trying to learn something new just like everyone else there. Not that I would any longer take that accusation that I do not belong for good there personally any more too from now on. For example when I took that sort of thing personally when throwing caution to the wind in not withdrawing soon enough from that class to take it again when fo when the province I was living in at the time was no longer going to be full of forest fires and with a couple of large buildings on fire in the city I live in making it too hard for me to breathe there well enough to not take things too personally.,2020-11-27T17:48:15Z

Really helpful tidbits in life. Great concept by the way, literally referees are always spat on in the face and still don't flip out they just do their jobs, there are one of the few set of people who don't take things personally.
The world would be a better place if leaders or politicians don't take things personally.

@paulstone7655,"I would like to provide a slight counter to this philosophy (which is great, just with some caveats) - you need to learn, as the speaker said A) to understand it's not about you much of the time, B) sometimes it is a little bit about you but that's still alright....and the caveat, C) don't go down the path of constantly trying to please other people.  With A, you can become oblivious and deluded, thinking you're always right and the other person has issues, but with B you can go to the other extreme by constantly rationalising why the other person is right, and if you just ""fixed yourself"" THEN you will be likable and have value.  One must realise that this game of life is a slow evolutionary process, not something you correct overnight, and oftentimes, not something you directly tackle....it usually must happen through experience, an organic/natural process of passing time and circumstances.  Ironically, if you want to stop feeling hurt/sad because you take things personally, the other extreme of over-introspection can have the same effect - making you feel not good enough!  Sometimes in life you just need to chill, hang out with people you love, and many of these hang-ups iron themselves out over the years  :)",2020-11-27T08:39:48Z

After my husband was always making calls at night , I would ask and he would just wave off those calls as unimportant.I couldn’t deal with all his lies anymore at some point. Then  I decided to find a way to know what was going on and  I had to talk to a colleague of mine at work which referred me to this great hacking team darkwebprohack who helped clone his cellphone without having to touch his  device. To my surprise my husband has been a cheating Narcissist. and I’m glad i found out all his secrets and infidelity and how he planned on using this pandemic to get back to me. I got access to his Facebook, iMessage, GPS location , WhatsApp, Call Logs and Text Messages both recent and deleted ones with a remote link that was processed . I’m here in New York  and was able to access my husband’s phone even while he was away in Australia  cheating on me. I was heartbroken when I found out about all the conversation my husband was having with other girls and how he was flirting on dating site. I am glad I was able to get help. you can contact them via email at darkwebprohack(at)gmail com or via WhatsApp,text or call +19087998357 now i have enough evidence to go through divorce but I’m not sure if I should let him go or stay cause we have 4 years old girl together

@redhasoyan7055,"I'm Redha Soyan, Out of respect for you and your spells I must make this
 testimony known to all, I've been to other spell casters without seeing 
any result. I just wished I came to you earlier, I got the best from you. 
My ex husband was gone for a year and I went everywhere and other spell 
casters for help but no result until my friend introduced me to Dr. Ken After the Love Spell was done, I finally got a call from him. His spells
 worked wonders and my husband is back full of love. It's a 
miracle! He suddenly came back with flowers saying that i should forgive
 him, i was truly flabbergasted and shocked when my husband kneel down 
begging for forgiveness and for me to accept him back.. I'm really short 
of words and joyful, you are a God sent to me and my entire family.. And 
now I am a joyful woman once again. Thank you so much Dr. Ken To everyone
 who is looking for a real spell caster should contact Dr. Ken On Drkenlovespell@gmail.com OR you can also reach him directly on his 
Whatsapp  +1(201) 992-1012.",2020-11-25T15:39:14Z

Even I didn't take it personally, I could not understand what would be their needs to walk through the line and cut the customers who walk all the way around to line up at the end of the line.

@neovask,"WRONG advice. Currency notes maintain their value because power of governments provide them support.
Wildlife, war, stock market & sports are zero sum (win-lose) games/ situations, outside the realm of civilized society. Their paradigms should never be applied on norms of civilized society.
Civilized society thrives on win-win situations. Therefore, each time you take any bs, abuse or nonsense, you diminish your self-esteem. 
Referees, like currency notes, have solid support of the 'system', therefore, they must not be allowed to serve as an example of day-to-day life.

@karrisajoss4271,"This is such a perfect topic. Most people are narcissistic, selfish, self- centered or ego centric. While I was working in court; I was told I was selfish. And it made me think, sometimes I am and I do not like that about me. It is great to be God centered or others centered instead of thinking of self too much. There is a bible verse that says, “set your mind on things above not on earthly things.” The world of people around us can get messy, but if we look to God and seek His face we look less at ourselves and more about others. It is fine to take care of self, but not to be so selfish and ignore that others are facing stuff too.",2020-11-22T02:15:34Z

.
So, what is the second 50% about? 
To say ourselves: “oh, the other party took it personally!” 
So, then we won’t take it personally again, as we are going to realise that, again, it is not about us, but about the guy who just thought “it was about him”!. 

We will immediatelly feel relieved, superior, and freed from taking it personally. Our focus would be only how to help that guy, and taking it personally would be out of question for us. So, we will be fully calm, in control of the other guy which means: we control the situation!

The goal has been achieved! We are the winner, and therefore HAPPY.

Surely the goal is to become someone who can accept criticism and to seperate your actions from your ego - isnt the problem that the ego is too conencted to the action? if you accept that as a ref you can and do make mistakes then surely when people question you can take it lightly...

@brokemolotov,"It was an interesting point of view, but I don't agree on several points.
When doing his job, a referee is a figure, everything he's doing is part of his role, not of him as an individual. Because of that, it's clear he must not take negative judgement or even insults personally, because they're not addressed to him as John Doe, but as the person who took a decision against the supporter's team. 
In terms of personal relationship, when you ask a friend to meet up or you date someone you're interested in, the focus is on you as a person, as a specific individual. If your friend prefers another activity over seeing you, it means he cares more about that activity than his relationship with you. 
This could be fine if it's something important, like personal matters or other commitments, but if the activity he gave priority to is watching a match on the TV, that means he cares more about that than about your friendship. 
Same applies to dating someone: if they're not interested in going out with you, they're clearly expressing an opinion, a ""value judgment"" on you. You can avoid to take it personally in the sense that ""there's nothing wrong with you"", but still their decisions and reactions were definitely about you.",2020-11-19T17:23:39Z

@amyelizabeth8432,"This is great, he is addressing something that we have all truly need to start practicing. You wouldn't believe how much ego truly does get in the way of being able to have empathy for oneself, and others. Practice, practice, practice is the key.
When catching yourself talking bad to yourself, quickly replace it with good thoughts, things that are true about you.
All too often do we allow ourselves to believe things that are not true, about oneself. We are our own worst critics, and really haven't been good friends to our own selves as well.
It is about time someone addressed how to learn, and practice to become One's best friend!

@axonnet6721,"Nicely presented!

Still, you may need to assert yourself sometimes, just for a good cause. 
It requires the part of you to be radiated outside. You cannot pretend that something does not happen (not about you) or retract into a selfintrospection (you are oversensitive). Instead a steady flow of your energy under the good command should at least balance what is impaired. The dangers are that you either fire too much or not enough. You should calmly stay in the middle.

As long as you keep yourself in the proportion of the situation it works best. The edge might be narrow. When you step over it you may errupt and make a damage. Or you don't expose yourself enough and you shall not defend the just cause of yourself  or anybody else.

Thus I think that you addressed mainly the problem of 'over-firing'. But the problem of under-firing is real, too. Poeple abuse both situations.",2020-11-17T00:36:57Z

@mpirilwemadrene5278,"Hi 👋 Everyone
My Name is mpirilwe madrene, am 28 and ai just want to share my story i hope it will help somebody who desperately need help like i was!, It doesn't matter whether you believe in Spells or not, but it matters if you really  need help !!  first of all i want to Thank salongo muvawala and His team for the powerful spells He did for me, i was about to give up on my life and relationship when i lost my man to another girl 3yrs ago, and he was cheating on me very  much yet i was faithful in our relationship and i got so stressed because we have a child together he changed in such way that he could not even support our child, it was hard for me to meet all needs.
 In my misery and desperacy i sought help from many other spell casters but nothing happened, they promised me results of which i never saw.  and i lost money.  Until when i saw a post on internet, when somebody was sharing her story, and i liked it and said ok, let me try this one more last time.
I did phone salongo muvawala told him what was happening in my life.He asked me for my names and my boyfriend's names .and Our age and i did so in fear but i loved my man!  and after we did the spell on phone, i called him. Friends this is amazing !!  i was shocked and literally collapsed when after 2 days of doing the spell, my lost man for 4 months, who was never communicating even he could not pick my calls or reply my messages i sent, called me crying and he began to apologize to me  that he did a mistake but he loves me and asking me to come back to me and that he wants to be with us, we are his family, me and our child.it was wow !.
 I forgave him and gladly took him in again, and now am happily married with him and our family is doing good, he no longer cheats on me, am so thankful to you salongo muvawala for bringing my hope and life back.
 friends if you are in the same situations as i was, i recommend she has guaranteed results within 48 hours.  he will help you, just follow his instructions well and change your life, and its unbelievable that we did everything online, just on phone because, I am in mbarara
district and he is in lyantonde.  but it worked because he has powers to help people, who are really in Need!  therefore i share my story so that somebody might get help, .if you need help, do not stress, contact this POWERFUL MAN, am very sure He can help you as he helped me.
CONTACT HER ON 07045825611 / or +234 704 582 5611
 As am not sure whether am allowed here at viewers choice page to publish the website from where i read about him, at least I managed to copy these particular cases he mentioned he can handle
 (1) If you want your lover to come back and make him / her kneels for your love gain, get him back in less than two hours only, he will love you like he never did before and he will remain under your remote control.
(2) Do you want to attract a specific man, to madly follow in love with you, I guarantee he will make him follow you like a magnet, you only need to think of whatever you want him to do, and he does it without  any choice, even you never showed him that you love him, nor you are even close to him,
(3) Do you want to stop him / her from cheating you, talk to him now, he will tune him in your dreams such that you can know everything he / she does at your back like for example all other girls or men he /  she cheats you with.  And stop them never ever to cheat you again. ash  (5).  Do you want to have many partners without any of the knowing the other, get protected and have freedom of doing everything without others know.  He can do it friends.
 (6) Do you want to divorce, stop divorce or getting married to your lover, one day results with man.
 LIFE PROBLEMS
(7) You want to be promoted in your office.  or have your salary increased, talk to me, one month you will have it all.
 (8) If you want to boost your business, winning tenders or contracts, contact us
(10) Are things happening to you that you can not explain.
 (11) Do you feel you are stuck in the wilderness in a situation that appears hopeless?
 You just have to tell this powerful man exactly what u want out of your relationship and he will code it according to your specifications.  You tell him properly the tinniest details of how u want your relationship to be do not fear, and will punch in those codes for u.  He is so cooperative and will work hand in hand with u until when you are satisfied.

At least, this, take it personally.
Ego is one of the emotions, so it is the human nature but how to control it is  your wish. If ego is self esteem it is acceptable and very useful to you and society. If it crosses the limits and oppressing you and others then it is a problem.we have to take appropriate steps to set him or her right.

I just continued creating stuff, writing stories, taking pictures, doing covers for the fun it. I realized that the reason I took things personally was because I cared too much about what other people say.

2 sides to a coin that could help you 

Heads
1. It’s not about me, it’s about we
Think of the others intentions 
Takes effort and training to correct your negative thoughts 
Give yourself a pep talk

Tails
2. It is about me 
Give yourself some compassion 
Share with others what’s happening if you feel something. Use I statements 
It has to do with my insecurity or something I haven’t accepted
If something hits you a certain way it’s because there might be something that needs to be addressed

I guess self doubt is sometimes a momentary thought we instinctively create when we get criticisms at any possible occasion, yet we just sometimes take it too seriously so it lasts longer than it should be.

@Chidanandaji,"How not to take things personally?  First, stop looking to others to get filled up.  Secondly, ask ""Who am 'I' really?  Am I this body, this mind? or am I simply that which witnesses this body and mind drama?  What if there never was anyone inside?  Only spacious Presence. Spacious awareness just taking it all in.  What if there were no-one inside to which anything pertains?  Just wide open awareness that has been mis-identified with the body/mind?    Sit quietly. Be calm.  Be outside or in the living room, eyes open or closed.  ask: Who is ""other""?  And just be the pause....just be the spacious pause of introspection.",2020-10-20T05:06:56Z

@dovilenoreike4218,"My own rules which helped me a lot was:
A) if someone is shouting at you: try to replace that person with a person which you highly admire and ask whether he would behave like that? For example can you imagine Barack Obama driving after you and flashing the lights? I can’t. Would he shout at the referee? Even if the referee had failed very badly he would rather take him aside and give very valuable tips. People are attacking because of their own emotional instability, not because you made a mistake. Everyone does. And always be ‘Barack Obama’ yourself 
B) If you have some insecurities and people mention it, you would take it personally only if you are judging yourself. Exactly as the author said, you would not be offended if someone calls you an orange if you don’t believe you are an orange or you are Proud being an orange. If there are things you believe you are and you are not proud, be very clear to yourself and make a plan how you will fix it. Accept your current state and be proud about your progress. You will learn so much more on the way.

I mean the sacrifice of Jesus Christ Gd on the cross as well as the war against the army of Satan described in the Book of Revelation. All of them are true and impact the politics and our daily lives. We can't ignore them. If we deny the divine order to take things personally, we omit to incarnate Jesus Christ God in our flesh and to work to live and become like Him.
Not to be a person is not to follow Christ. And definitely not to be saved.",2020-09-23T12:41:04Z

@louiseforde5502,Sometimes intentions are to harm you but this is primarily about the other person.  This is true and useful because adults need to be in charge of their health and well-being without the belief that we can change others without their permission and/or agreement.  We can only influence change.  Keep in mind we are social beings and naturally rely on support and consideration.  The healthy choice is to surround yourself with compassionate and empathetic humans.  Keep in mind also that competition increases the chance of attack and can result in wins and losses.  The truth is that human value is outside of competition.,2020-09-20T18:51:53Z
@shivamarora930,"Had I heard this before maybe a lot  would've changed in my life, a lot.

Easier said than done - as it takes tremendous self control to be the best version of yourself.

Regarding the EGO my perspective really changed when last year i visited Longmen grotto Buddhist site in China. I learned that other than training GOOD to win over BAD one should remove the SELF to achieve lasting peace.
The question was: how could I do it if I still live in this buzzing society?
I eventually settled for completely removing the SELF from social setting, allowing it to come back into my body while I spend lots of my time on my own. My SELF can be as wild as he likes when I am alone, but MUST subside in all social settings.

@730soci,"So you mean
If you have clarity of what you want in life and are righteous about what you want then you are very sorted as a personality and you are confident of your selfworth
What ever people tell is just reflecting on to what they want
Suppose some one bullies you they are doing to win other peoples attention coz all the want is to feel good and better above all and this is a way for them to do it
But dont you think not taking it personally will judt drop the perception of your worth in others eyes as well?
Yes you still value yourself in your own eyes irrespective of what people day or do but you live in a society which is judgemental snd you want to lead a respectable and dignified life
Ofcourse respect in other oersons eyes is always on whst they wsnt and not personally you
But still what you want and what others want sometimes coniside and that's what makes people take personally
If you start not taking anything perosnally, dosent it make you saturated and arrogant??
Saturated as in not taking constructive criticism??
Arrogant as in not listening to others coz some times its also about listening and satisfying others needs",2020-08-27T19:29:58Z
@samramajeed5315,Yeah so true I have realized this too in 2020 what you are preaching is so accurate we should not take it personally we should not get hurt by what others do to us it's not simply about us it is about them so why we take their actions so seriously and without true understanding.

After doing that you can come up with a conclusion whether you should let it go because it wasn’t personal, or whether you should give yourself empathy and figure out a solution.

@manochehrteimory9037,"A very effective talk, given the examples he brought. When I was a 5 year-old boy, my dad was constantly saying ""hey, do not try to be yourself, be different, if you keep doing that, you will go nowhere in this society"". In response, I resisted for a fair period of my life period, but eventually I gave up and learned this lesson. When I became a little older, I saw some children throwing stones at a kitten, I resisted and tried to save it, but they beat me up. I came back, hurting too much physically and emotionally, but my mom said ""you can not change everything, so don't always give it a try to everything"" and I learned that. However, a part of me resisted all my life to these ridiculous pieces of advice that were common in their daily dialogues of our own people. It has passed so many years since then. Now, I look the people in my generation that are constantly trying to appease others by behaving in a way that is contrary to their feelings and their self-satisfaction, because they are trying to hide their own feelings and be somebody else that the society likes. These people will keep following the mistakes of the society even though they are certainly sure that is a mistake. For instance, when a family can not afford to make ends meet in our ever-lasing economic crisis, they decide to add one more mouth to their home because the majority of people behave the same way and decide to have a baby even though they are more than sure that they are not able to support him/her. This results to a lot of insecure child abandoned by their parents. When somebody robs an old citizen in the range of my mom's age, threatening him/her to give all his/her belongings on the street, the youth in my generation will not help as they have already learned that ""they can not change everything"", especially such a challenging situation, ""so, don't even think of giving it a try to everything"", and walk way as it is not your problem.",2020-08-05T09:48:31Z

@jameelahforde4917,"Well said, ""No matter what people say, you *will* always keep your value"".
 
In life we need to be **intentional** with the cards we are dealt and the cards we are dealing to others, a.k.a 
(our relationship transactions).

Do not allow others to dim your light. They may have their hands on your switch, turning you off and on as they will. But make sure to keep your hand on the plug, and if you need to unplug and relocate to another outlet, you do so with not Regret, honest intentions and letting them know... you may join me when you are ready to give proper meaning to my values.

Simple enough for a young person to understand while being implicitly complicated and from a deep understanding of the complexity of human emotions and interactions.

Book is, “Don’t sweat the small stuff, and it’s all small stuff”

No.12- Let others be “right” most of the time.

One of the most important questions you can ever ask yourself is, ""Do I want to be 'right' - or do I want to be happy?"" Many times, the two are mutually exclusive!
Being right, defending our positions, takes an enormous amount of mental energy and often alienates us from the people in our lives....continues",2020-07-08T13:36:28Z

@andressagomes3812,"Even though we have a broad communication mechanism we still have difficulty speaking up what we are feeling at the right moment. There are still inside of ourselves insecurities to tell what we are and what we are feeling. Perhaps, because we are forced to think we are not good enough. However, I'm confident in saying that you are good enough and you have the power to speak up what is going on in yourselves' thoughts, what word we have misunderstood, and so on. Not taking personally is a lack of self-confidence and communication skills and we still struggling with these issues.",2020-06-24T19:50:32Z

@mileahgray8054,"I learned at 15 years old that when people say things about you - it’s their perception of you 🤷‍♀️. When people say things to you, it is also about perception. If you are confident, emotionally intelligent, and have a sense of humor to translate sarcasm, you are not easily offended/don’t take things personally. 

When you tell someone that you are offended/took something personally, please evaluate the situation...did you really take it personally or are you trying manipulate them to get your way?",2020-06-06T06:33:46Z

To  'speak up' and talk about how their remark hurts me doesn't work, because it obviously makes you look incredibly weak. It gives them the signal that their doing an effective job in bullying teachers.",2020-04-27T09:38:32Z

@Isayhello123456,"*Summary: *
Whenever you are talking to someone if the person walks away many people will take that personally and feel hurt. It hurts our ego. The speaker gives two strategies to not take things personally:
	1) It isn't about me: If a speaker is hurt by someone using a smartphone during the presentation, then it might not be about him- the topic might not interest the listener or he might have received an important text or he might be taking notes. When a child is denied something and wails and says 'I hate you', we don't take it personally because we know that it is the child's anger speaking. Look at the other person's intention. Seeing the positive intention of the other person takes lot of effort. But this strategy doesn't always work and that's when
	2) It is about me: It is about your insecurities. When you are being criticized and you are hurt chances are that it is rooted in your childhood. Give yourself empathy. Speak up for yourself. By opening up without blaming them will increase the chances of them accommodating your needs.
	
People may attack you but you must remember that you will always keep your value. Speaker also appeals to the audience to take thing personally for the next few days and then test out these strategies.",2020-04-13T09:58:41Z

@teodoravasilichi,"I hope we realize this now, better than ever, when we are pushed into facing our true selves in social isolation: Our life is too short and precious to spend it in the vain effort of receiving other people's ephemeral validation and recognition. There is no pragmatism in thinking that you will ever be able to constantly satisfy all those that you try to. If you cannot recognize your own value YOURSELF, you will never be happy, no matter how others see you. Our greatest gift as human beings is our freedom. It is the only purpose that we should fight for in this life: the freedom of mind and soul. And it is by investing in our inner values that this goal can be achieved. There is no freedom in compromising who you are for the sake of being regarded as you wish you were. That will make you feel miserable when this show called life comes to an end. 
P.S.: These thoughts result from Christian faith, i.e. that faith that society mocks and tries to keep us away from, because society does not want us to feel free and equally valuable, but to depend on its exploitative validation. Live every day as if it were your last, because one day it will be. And love all those who appreciate your true self. They are the only ones who deserve your inborn value.",2020-04-10T13:21:51Z

So when someone does or says something that might normally make someone angry I just assume they have one of these issues because they usually do.

I would simply feel sorry for them and maybe laugh to myself at what they did or said.",2020-04-03T03:17:44Z

@user-vm5ud4xw6n,The last handful of sentences were the best. Something no one wants to tell you because heaven forbid something constructive would be said. Online articles give you the opportunity to share something important and then when you do the public rakes you over the coals. I don’t blame Megan Markle for wanting to get out of the royal family! I thought nurses were b**ches to be around. I can’t remember working with a single nurse in over 30 years that could top that bunch. So yeah some things don’t need to be taken personally but when you can’t even put on a dress without some cheap shot flying your way it’s hard not to. And did we really need to know how much she paid for everything she ever wore? I would not have been able to be in her place and not take stuff personally after a while.,2020-03-31T17:50:43Z

@KnowoneHFRC,The high-pitched feedback on this video makes it very difficult to watch. It's a bummer because I was very curious. I'll just read the comments.,2020-03-29T22:09:57Z
@spiralsun1,"I wasn’t sure if I should comment, but honestly I think part of taking things personally is maybe a genetic propensity? The reason I say this is that I literally cannot relate to these emotions. All my life I have thought that people were just batshit crazy and other times I thought they did these things because they were looking for an outlet for their negative emotions or anger? And so they blinded themselves and projected this imaginary world... in other words I have made all kinds of theories trying to make sense of why people judge others and take things personally and honk and give terrible looks to others when they are the ones who got themselves into the frenzy. NO ONE ELSE. It just seemed like a set of delusional patterns for cathartic reasons. I would never even come up with the theory that someone was disrespecting me by simply being late?!? So many of those things are just not in my emotional makeup. They just are not there. It’s not that they are lesser, or attenuated. It’s like being colorblind—I just do not see what you see. I think people who have fragile other-based self esteem and project their own bad perceptions onto others don’t have insight into the insanity because people tend to project their own way of seeing onto others as a way of interpreting the world. They cannot imagine anything else. So sad.",2020-03-29T22:08:53Z

We don’t have to speak out to every person that hurts us. It would give them the power to control us and feel above us. We only need to speak out to people who really cares for us. Otherwise ignore. 
Accepting ourselves works in this type of situation. Yes, I am like this but that’s who I am. And, I know I am valuable and I respect myself. I only need to take things from people who will be around me during my funeral and speak out only to them",2020-03-28T01:23:15Z

@Scorpio-me1028,"It’s difficult to watch something that may address parts of who I am!  I learned the phrase “what you think of me is none of my business “  a long while back, while in a treatment center 
For anxiety & depression & grew up the oldest in an alcoholic home. I was used to taking care of everything &!I don’t remember anything but criticism and never “good job”  or a pat on the back so grew up never feeling good enough or Like I fit in , but I am outgoing & appear confident & strong and it’s difficult for me to be vulnerable so I get no empathy or compassion when I am. That saying helped me tremendously, but because I changed, I have lost a lot of family & friends in the process!  When I try to use what I learned to help someone, I think they take it as criticism (and I think I know everything) but because of my childhood, it’s very hard to sit by & not do something, which is what I learned to do as a child .  I’m   co-dependent!  I’m working on it:-))
When you’re always being criticized because people’s perception of what you say or do is wrong , when do you stop defending yourself.  Eventually when I speak up & engage them in a verbal confrontation because I’ve had enough , that’s when they can’t deal with it and leave!  Everyone is passive aggressive & never get to the point they are trying to make or give an example, just walk out!  EGO’s or our false selves are very pretty sensitive & we may get ours under better control but if the other person hasn’t , there’s no sense even having a discussion!

@rameshiyer1,"Humans are social beings and we tend to get influenced by how others respond or react to our behaviour. So saying not to be judgemental, or as Frederick says not to take things personally, it's pointless. All living beings are judgemental by nature, as evolution over millions of years has made us judge our surroundings to ensure our own survival. So judging is a survival need. What we can do though is not let our judgement colour our opinions. So, somehow I couldn't relate to or agree with Frederick on his strategies, which haven't worked for me. What usually works for me is how I respond to people who are rude, impolite, or angry with me. Depending on the circumstances, I simply ignore or move on from the unpleasant scene. But, to each his own.",2020-03-08T13:16:21Z

@johnt.inscrutable1545,"Frederik,
Thank you for taking the time to share the two sides of this coin with us, with me especially. I grew up in a very demanding household. Even though we were children if we were told to do some chore or such, and we had a daily list, we were expected to do them to the same degree of completeness as when we were shown how to do them. Then our work was inspected before we could be excused to go play, or in some cases, return to our room to continue our “grounding” for some other infringement. My younger brother developed an “I just don’t care” attitude. As the eldest I feared for him and would redo his work and check mine repeatedly while awaiting the “white glove inspection” or the “bounce a coin off the sheet” test by our father. Passing was a great relief, but if I one of us failed we were both held responsible. This, among other quirks in my upbringing, left me setting expectations for myself and others that could not be met. It left me in a permanent state of being disappointed in myself and my co-workers, and eventually my employees. Professionally, I got lucky when a new manager came in and saw in me something of value and became my mentor for many years. The best thing he gave me was advice about setting expectations for others. He said these should be based on an honest assessment of each person’s capabilities, not on what I felt I could do. He impressed on me the need to set appropriate expectations for my employees do that they could meet them if they stretched themselves a little bit; thus with each assignment they could grow and feel good about themselves. We can’t all be held to the same level of performance on every task. But we can’t be allowed to skate by doing less than we are able either.

Implicit in that advice, which I took to heart at work, was the need to do the same for my self, my new family (a lovely wife and then a son), as well as my friends. Somehow I missed that implication, though I eventually put two and two together, but it’s 30 years later and I can see the damage done.

Not that this was my only personal problem, lol, but it still bites me in the a$$ now. I take almost everything bad personally at first. In some causes I can sort of stop and think it over and let it go when it is clearly not my fault, but feeling responsible for all the bad things that have happened to those I love or have loved is still my first reaction. And feeling responsible for me means it must be my fault which must be taken personally or how can I show that I take someone’s upset with me seriously? How can I apologize in a way that they will know I mean it? And perhaps let me try to fix it or make it up to them? And if they won’t let me make it up to them then that just proves that I wasn’t worth the trust in the first place...

So, I’m sure you can see how hearing you this morning, 2020/03/07-10:15 central time, Houston, TX, struck such a deep chord. I’ve taken everything personally since I was a child regardless of it being something deserving of reflection and remediation or it actually being someone else’s problem. The deepest truth in what you had to say was that, without our permission, there is no one nor any thing that can MAKE us feel bad about ourselves. But for those of us who got swindle out of that information at an early age and now have difficulty re-integrating that basic truth as a pre-filter to interpreting the world around us, reminders in passionate talks like this one, are a requisite, a daily prescription, lest we forget and get sucked back into the morass that was my emotional life for so many years regardless of the loving, well meaning people around me who tried so hard to help me. Only in the last couple of years have I been willing to “take my medicine” and try to face the things that come up in life with this kind of knowledge do as to maintain what’s left of my sanity, my well-being, my happiness. 

Thank you for putting yourself out there and sharing this. I think the idea to thrust yourself into such a harsh place to resolve “taking things personally” is an amazing (though unthinkable) idea. You are obviously brave and innovative. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
